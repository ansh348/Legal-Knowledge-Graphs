By that Proclamation, the Indian Limitation Act IX of 1908 was made applicable to that State with effect from February 1, 1926, subject to this modification that all suits which would have been in time according to the old law of the State but would have become barred by limitation as a result of the introduction of the Indian Limitation Act, could be filed up to January 31, 1929, by virtue of certain modifications extending the last date for the institution of such suits. Hence, the suit filed on that date in the Munsiffs Court at Miraj, was admittedly within time, and was subject to the law of limitation under the Indian Limitation Act. When the plaint was returned by the Munsiffs Court at Miraj, at the instance of the plaintiff himself on the ground of want of pecuniary jurisdiction, and re-presented to the Court of the District Judge at Miraj on July 4, 1940, it was, on the face of it, barred by limitation, whether the period of limitation started to run in 1910 or 1915, unless the case is brought within section 14 of the Limitation Act."

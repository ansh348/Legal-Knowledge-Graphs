The question whether the account should be reopened from 1922 or from 1931 was number raised by the decree-holders at all. he decree-holders have number companye up on appeal before us on a certificate granted by the High Court under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Sri G.N. Kunzru appearing in support of this appeal has strongly questioned the companyrectness of the Full Bench deci- sion relied on by the High Court and the interpretation put by the High Court on section 21 and section 2  9  of the Act. As we think this appeal can be decided on a simpler ground we do number companysider it necessary, on this occasion, to express any opinion on either of these questions which are by numbermeans free from doubt.

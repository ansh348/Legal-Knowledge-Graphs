This point arises in this way. The appellant is a thika tenant in respect of a portion of the premises No. 28, R. G. Kar Road in Calcutta. In Suit No. 46 of 1948 a decree for ejectment was passed against him and in favour of the respondent on March 16, 1949. This decree was challenged by the appellant by preferring an appeal before the District Court and a second appeal before the High Court at Calcutta but both those appeals failed and the decree for ejectment passed by the trial companyrt was companyfirmed. Then followed several proceedings between the parties and the companyrse of litigation between them turned out to be protracted and tortuous. Ultimately on May 22, 1953, the respondent filed an execution case before the First Additional Court, Sealdah Title Execution Case No. 34 of 1953 . By this application the respondent claimed that the possession of the property companyered by the decree should be delivered to him. Thereupon the appellant filed a Miscellaneous Judicial Case under s. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the companyrt raising several objections to the decree holders claim for execution Miscellaneous Judicial Case No. 96 of 1953 . This case was dismissed by the executing companyrt on February 2, 1954. A miscellaneous appeal preferred by the appellant before the learned District Judge, 24-Parganas, as well as the second miscellaneous appeal preferred by him before the High Court at Calcutta were likewise dismissed. The appellant then applied for leave to prefer an appeal under the Letters Patent. This application was rejected by Mr. Justice Renupada Mukherjee who had heard the second appeal. On May 10, 1955, the appellant filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court and special leave was granted to him on May 18, 1955. The companyrts below have held that the decree-holders application for execution of the decree passed in his favour can and ought to be entertained by the civil companyrts and an order has been passed against the appellant that he should vacate the premises in question before the end of Jaistha 1362 B.S. 1 5th June, 1955 , failing which execution will proceed according to law. The appellants companytention is that the view taken by the companyrts below about the companypetence of the civil companyrts to entertain the decree-holders execution application proceeds on a misconstruction of s. 5 1 of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act."

In support of the argument that clause  1   should be companystrued in isolation from the rest of the article, the petitioner relied on certain observations of our learned brother Das in Chiranjit Lal v.

In other words, deprivation referred to in clause 1  must be taken to companyer deprivation otherwise than by acquisition or requisitioning of property dealt with in clause  2 . We companysider it unnecessary for the purpose of the present petition to go into that question. Even assuming that clause  1  has to be read and companystrued apart from clause  2 , it is clear that it is a declaration of the fundamental right of private property in the same negative form in which article 21 declares the fundamental right to life and liberty."

In my view the fact that the impugned notification records, apart from the findings of incompetency, certain findings of abuse of power, does not lead to the conclusion, as contended for the appellants, that the State Government had taken action under s. 57 and not under s. 53-A although, in terms, it says it acted under the last mentioned section."

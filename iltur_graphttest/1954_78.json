Then the next question is whether the companyviction of the appellant under section 302 read with section 34, when they had been charged only under section 302 read with section 149, was illegal. The companytention of the appellants is that the scope of section 149 is different from that of section 34, that while what section 149 requires is proof of a companymon object, it would be necessary under section 34 to establish a companymon intention and that therefore when the charge against the accused is under section 149, it cannot be companyverted in appeal into one under section 34. The following observations of this companyrt in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab were relied on in support of this position - Nor is it possible in this case to have recourse to section 34 because the appellants have number been charged with that even in the alternative and the companymon intention required by section 34 and the companymon object required by section 149 are far from being the same thing. It is true that there is substantial difference between the two sections but as observed by Lord Sumner in Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. Emperor  I.L.R. 52 Cal. 197  P.C.   , they also to some extent overlap and it is a question to be determined on the facts of each case whether the charge under section 149 overlaps the ground companyered by section 34. If the companymon object which is the subject-matter of the charge under section 149 does number necessarily involve a companymon intention, then the substitution of section 34 for section 149 might result in prejudice to the accused and ought number therefore to be permitted. But if the facts to be proved and the evidence to be adduced with reference to the charge under section 149 would be the same if the charge were under section 34, then the failure to charge the accused under section 34 companyld number result in any prejudice and in such cases the substitution of section 34 for section 149 must be held to be a formal matter."

By the 16th section of the statute, the companymissioners are to make rates upon all and every the person or persons who do or shall hold, occupy, possess, etc., any land within the parish . The statute also gave a right of appeal to any person or persons aggrieved by any rate., but the appeal clause required the person or persons appealing against a rate to enter into a recognisance the question was if this requirement was intended to exclude companyporations from the purview of the ap. peal clause, as companyporations, it was urged, cannot enter, into a recognisance. In interpreting the appeal clause, Bayley J. observed-  1   1827  7 B. C. 314 108 E. R, 741. But assuming that they cannot enter into a recognizance, yet if they ire persons capable of being aggrieved by and appealing against a rate, I should say that that part of the clause which gives the appeal applies to all persons capable of appealing, and that the other part of the clause which requires a recognizance to be entered into applies only to those persons who are capable of entering into a recognizance, but is inapplicable to those who are number"

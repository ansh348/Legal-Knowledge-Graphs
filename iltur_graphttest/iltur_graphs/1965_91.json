Book profit before appropriation of income-tax, etc. 1,01,902 Less Taxes actually payable on total income as finally determined on appeal 81,529 Profits available for distribution 20,373 Dividends declared by the company 45,000 He felt these figures showed that the assessee company could not reasonably have declared dividend of more than Rs. 20,373, but he observed In the case of banking companies or companies with income from property, the computation of income for purposes of the Income-tax Act may in some cases be different from that adopted by the companies themselves. Hence, there may be variation between the assessable income and profits made. In such cases, if the companies are asked to declare dividends on the basis of assessable income, the companies may be forced to declare dividends out of capital which is prohibited under the Companies Act. In this case the difference between the assessable income and profits made is not due to any such variation on the basis of any different statutory of luggage collections and to the addition of Rs. 20,000 made on account of luggage collections and to the addition of Rs. 25,000 on account of spare parts, etc. These additions have been sustained by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. This clearly shows that the books are not so properly maintained as to deduce the distributable income from the assessee companys book profits. Moreover if the additions of Rs. 45,000 are made to the profits of Rs. 20,373 available for distribution, the company could very well have declared a larger dividend than what has been actually declared by it. I, therefore, apply the provisions of section 23A."

He further observed that at the time the accounts were made up the directors must have been aware that the profits as per books were very much less than the real profits, as the book profits had been shown at a lesser figure by inflation of the first and the third items and suppression of the second item. In view of these considerations, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the Income-tax Officer justified in rejection the appellants contention regarding the adequacy of dividends declared and in applying the provisions of section 23A."

He further urged before us that this Court had held in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Gangadhar Banerjee & Co. that the burden lay upon the revenue to prove that all the conditions laid down in section 23A were satisfied before the order was made, and he said that one of the conditions was that the Income-tax Officer, after having examined the question, was satisfied that having regard to the losses incurred by the company in earlier years or to the smallness of the profits made the payment of a dividend or a larger dividend than that declared would not be unreasonable. He further relied on the following observations of Subba Rao J. in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Gangadhar Banerjee Co. Would the satisfaction of the Income-tax Officer depend only on the two circumstances, namely, losses and smallness of profit ? Can he take into consideration other relevant circumstances ? What does it mean commercial or accounting profits ? If the scope of the section is properly appreciated, the answer to the said question would be apparent. The Income-tax Officer, acting under this section, is not assessing any income to tax that will be assessed in the hands of the shareholders. He only does what the directors should have done. He puts himself in the place of the directors. Though the object of the section is to prevent evasion of tax, the provision must be worked not from the standpoint of the tax collector but from that of a businessman. The reasonableness or the unreasonableness of the amount distributed as dividends is judged by business considerations, such as the previous losses, the present profits, the availability of surplus money and the reasonable requirements of the future and similar others. He must take an overall picture of the financial position of the business."

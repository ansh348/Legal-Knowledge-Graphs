Therefore, the scope of Section 25 of the Act is very wide as the High Court can under this provision examine the record of the appellate authority as to the regularity of such proceeding or the correctness, legality or propriety of any decision or order passed therein and can modify, annul, reverse or remit for reconsideration. This expression in the Act has a wide import and the very fact that the High Court can examine the correctness, legality or propriety of the order necessarily goes to show that the High Court has power to examine the matter with reference to facts also."

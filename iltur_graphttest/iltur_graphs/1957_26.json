This basis of classification is clearly companynected with the underlying principle of admin- istration of justice that an alleged criminal should be placed on his trial as soon after the companymission of the crime as circumstances of the case would permit. This classification cannot be said to be unreasonable and number to have any relation to the object of the legislation, namely, a more speedy trial of offences without any avoidable delay.

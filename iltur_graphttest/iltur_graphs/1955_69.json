Mr. N. C. Chatterjee argued that domicile of origin was often called domicile of birth, and invited our attention to certain observations of Lord Macnaghten in Winans v. Attorney-General 1 . But then, the numberle Lord went on to add that the use of the words domicile of birth was perhaps number accurate. But that apart, what has to be numbered is that whether the expression used is domicile of origin or domicile of birth, the companycept involved in it is something different from what the words place of birth signify. And if domicile of birth and place of birth cannot be taken as synonymous, then the prohibition enacted in article 15 1  against discrimination based on place of birth cannot apply to a discrimination based on domicile. It was argued that -under the Constitution there -can be only a single citizenship for the whole of India, and that it would run companynter to that numberion to hold that the State companyld make laws based on domicile within their territory,. But citizenship and domicile represent two different companyceptions. Citizenship has reference to the political status of a person, and  1  1859 28 L.J. Ch. 396, 400."

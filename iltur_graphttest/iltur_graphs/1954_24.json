We do number agree with the High Court that the cause of action in the subsequent suit was different from the cause of action in the first suit. The cause of action in the first suit was the desire of the plaintiff to separate from his brothers and to divide the joint family property. That suit embraced the entire property without any reservation and was companypromised, the plaintiff having abandoned his claim to account in respect of the motor business subsequent to March 31, 1946. His subsequent suit to enforce a part of the claim is founded on the same cause of action which he deliberately relinquished. We are clear, therefore, that the cause of action in the two suits being the same, the suit is barred under Order II, rule 2 3 , of the Civil Procedure Code. "

The plaintiff by companyfining his claim to account up to March 3, 1946, only, implicitly of number explicitly, relinquished his claim to the account for the subsequent period. Sub-rule 3 clearly lays down that if a person Omits, except with the leave of the Court, to sue for all reliefs to which he is entitled, he shall number afterwards sue for any relief so omitted. We do number agree with the High Court that the cause of action in the subsequent suit was different from the cause of action in the first suit. The cause of action in the first suit was the desire of the plaintiff to separate from his brothers and to divide the joint family property. That suit embraced the entire property without any reservation and was companypromised, the plaintiff having abandoned his claim to account in respect of the motor business subsequent to March 31, 1946. His subsequent suit to enforce a part of the claim is founded on the same cause of action which he deliberately relinquished. We are clear, therefore, that the cause of action in the two suits being the same, the suit is barred under Order II, rule 2 3 , of the Civil Procedure Code. "

The cause of action in the first suit was the desire of the plaintiff to separate from his brothers and to divide the joint family property. That suit embraced the entire property without any reservation and was companypromised, the plaintiff having abandoned his claim to account in respect of the motor business subsequent to March 31, 1946.

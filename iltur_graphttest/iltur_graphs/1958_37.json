The learned Additional Civil Judge found that the suit was number barred because of the Act that the suit against the order of the House Allotment Officer was maintainable that newly constructed accommodation on the whole was bigger and more spacious than the old kacha hall and that the accommodation had increased and after taking into consideration the amount spent on the construction be increased the reasonable adequate rent to Rs. 55-8-0. Against this decree of the learned Judge the respondent took a revision to the High Court under s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The High Court was of the opinion that if the accommodation was a new construction erected after June 30, 1946, the suit was maintainable and- the High Court could number interfere with the finding of the Civil Judge as to the amount of rent."

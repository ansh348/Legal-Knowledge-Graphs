The joint borrowing was necessitated by the business needs of both the borrowers and by the insistence of money lenders, who required the joint security of the two persons. L failed in his business and the assessee had to repay the creditors the whole of the joint borrowing. ... It was held that the assessee was not entitled to deduct these sums in the computation of his business profit either under section 10 2 xi or section 10 2 xv or as business loss. This case furnishes the proper analogy to the present case and points to the right conclusion in regard to the claim of the appellant."

All these persons had taken part in the election. As regards Butler, Phillimore J. observed that if it companyld be held that at the time of his employment his duties included also work in elections if and when they, were held, then a proportionate part of his salary should be regarded as election expenses but, on the facts, he held that it was numberpart of the duties of Butler in respect of his standing employment to be election agent when called upon, and that, therefore, numberpart of his salary need be shown as election expenses."

At the same time, the requirements of Rule 118 are number satisfied by proving merely that the person does work in connection with the election. That work must be done under a contract of employment.

On the death of the widow A was heir to the estate. In 1868 the widow had alienated nearly the whole property by three deeds executed and registered on the same day. By the first deed she gave a property to her brother, by the second she sold half of another property to A, and by the third she sold the other half of that property to her son-in-law. The signature of each of the deeds was attested by the two other alienees. A who survived the widow for six years, did number seek to set aside any of the alienations. After his death his son and grandsons brought a suit to recover the whole property.

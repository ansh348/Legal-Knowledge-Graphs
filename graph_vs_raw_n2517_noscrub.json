The lower courts substantially accepted this evidence, indicating strong proof of common intention under Section 34 IPC for murder (302) and attempt to murder (307).

The appellant challenges only the High Court's upholding of section 4's validity (where they lost), while respondents challenge the Act's validity and High Court jurisdiction (where they lost), but the Court's focus on affirming legislative competence suggests no reversal favoring the appellant.

The cited precedents, particularly Narendra Kumar Sen, emphasize the 'community of interest' test, requiring workmen to have a direct or substantial interest in the dispute, which tea estate workers lack regarding the doctor's employment.

      "raw_reasoning": "The core issue is whether a dispute espoused by a union of workmen regarding the termination of Dr. K.P. Banerjee, an Assistant Medical Officer, constitutes an 'industrial dispute' under Section 2(k) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Dr. Banerjee performs professional medical duties, excluding him from the definition of 'workman' under Section 2(s), as he is neither engaged in manual, skilled, technical, operational, clerical, or supervisory work for hire nor akin to typical industrial employees. The statutory definition requires the dispute to be between employers and workmen; a union cannot convert a non-industrial dispute into an industrial one merely by espousing it, so the tribunals correctly held lack of jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court appeal is likely to be rejected."

The subsequent diversion to non-agricultural use, sanctioned before the sale deed, likely removed the land from occupancy tenure subject to Chapter XIV pre-emption. Courts below erroneously treated delayed execution as subterfuge; pre-emption rights, being restrictive, are strictly construed and accrue only on completed transfer, rendering the suit premature for 15/1 and inapplicable to other survey numbers where co-occupancy is absent."

Section 4 explicitly bars courts from entertaining suits or applications for injunctions to restrain such powers, and courts interpret this broadly to include declaratory relief with the same objective. The appellants' contention that Section 3(1) is limited to improvements of a 'tank' as strictly defined is unlikely to prevail, as the anicut supplies the tank and falls within the Act's scope."

Given the narrow question of law raised and the Supreme Court's scrutiny, the appeal is likely to be accepted, at least partly, by clarifying the law and possibly setting aside the convictions or enhanced death sentences for the appellants."

Exemption requires income to be applied or specifically accumulated/set apart for charitable purposes within taxable territories, which is not satisfied here, as supported by the cited precedent in Mohammad Ibrahim Riza v.

The core issue is the validity of the May 4, 1963 notification under Section 12 of the Excise Act applying Section 129 of the Customs Act, which the High Court held exceeded powers limited to specific provisions in the Fifth Schedule of the Sea Customs Act; this strict construction favors the respondent.

The consent decree with Allen Berry explicitly admits surrender of tenancy, invalid sub-letting without consent, and authorizes ejectment of the sub-tenant.

The High Court's ruling that it is an impermissible additional sales tax overlooks the specific statutory scheme for market committees and the quid pro quo for market services.

The High Court distinguished Sadasiva Murthy based on specific provisions like clause (c) unique to the Seventh Edition, and the Supreme Court is likely to uphold stare decisis on the Eighth Edition precedents rather than extend Sadasiva Murthy.

Such powers have been upheld in prior jurisprudence with procedural safeguards like authorization and witnesses. Case-specific non-constitutional claims under section 132 and Rule 112A do not undermine the overall validity, leading to rejection of the petitions and appeals."

Entry 25 of List II ('Gas and gas works') likely refers to artificial or manufactured gases, not natural gas derived from mineral oil resources. Consequently, the State of Gujarat lacks legislative competence for the Gujarat Gas Act, 2001, rendering it ultra vires, and the challenge to Union authority would be upheld by dismissing the writ petitions."

      "graph_reasoning": "The High Court set aside the arbitral award solely on the ground of refusal of adjournment for evidence, which does not constitute misconduct under the restrictive scope of Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, as affirmed by precedents like Arosan Enterprises and State of U.P. v. Allied Constructions. Courts cannot reappraise evidence or interfere with the arbitrator's discretionary procedural orders, especially in long-pending proceedings started in 1995 and concluding in 1999. The respondent's absence and frivolous explanation justified closure of evidence, warranting Supreme Court acceptance of the appeal to restore the award.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The High Court's decision to set aside the arbitration awards under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, solely for denying the respondent another opportunity to lead evidence after repeated adjournments and non-appearance despite presence at prior hearings, exceeds the limited grounds for interference, such as arbitrator misconduct or invalid procedure. The arbitrators exercised reasonable discretion by closing evidence after waiting 40 minutes on the scheduled date, and the respondent's explanation of noting the wrong date appears frivolous given their attendance on April 8, 1999. Supreme Court jurisprudence favors minimal judicial intervention in arbitration awards, supporting reversal of the High Court's order."

      "graph_reasoning": "The central issue is whether prior declaratory decrees in favor of the reversioner (appellant) operate as res judicata against the enlargement of Uttamdassi's limited maintenance estate into an absolute estate under Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Supreme Court precedents like V. Tulasamma v. Sesha Reddy establish that such limited estates enlarge automatically post-1956, overriding prior interpretations, and res judicata does not apply to pure questions of law or decrees contrary to prevailing statutory interpretation. Petitioner's arguments on prospective overruling and cases like Teg Singh (under different laws) are unlikely to prevail against the authoritative binding effect of Section 14 HSA and exceptions to res judicata.",

Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act explicitly protects the limited life interest granted by the Will (for maintenance, no alienation, reversion to daughter), preventing it from becoming absolute under Section 14(1), distinguishing from Tulasamma. The High Court erred in disregarding res judicata and misapplying Tulasamma, favoring acceptance of the appeal."

Directing creation of a new post and regularization thereon constitutes judicial overreach, as courts cannot mandate executive functions like post creation, consistent with principles in State of Karnataka v. Umadevi. The High Court erred in affirming the first appellate court's reversal without addressing substantial questions of law under Section 100 CPC."

Joshi v. State of Haryana (2003) which permits quashing under S.482 CrPC or Art.226 to prevent abuse of process and secure ends of justice. The offenses arise from a purely private commercial dispute with no broader public interest, and the complainant has withdrawn pursuit, favoring pragmatic quashing. The State's call for reconsidering B.S. Joshi lacks merit given consistent affirmation of High Court discretion in such matters."

Supreme Court doctrine favors strict but not hyper-technical construction of election petitions, mandating opportunities to cure defects rather than summary dismissal, especially when allegations of corrupt practices are specific.

The lower court's declaration affecting Lakshmi's marital status without notice violates natural justice (audi alteram partem), rendering it null and void.

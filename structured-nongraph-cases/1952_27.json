He then went on to discuss the question whether the account should be reopened from June 22, 1922, when the earlier mortgage was executed or from July 28, 1931, when the mortgage in suit was executed. After discussing that evidence the learned Judge came to the conclusion that so far as the judgment-debtors were concerned the mortgagees in the two mortgages were one and the same. Re-opening the accounts from June 22, 1922, the learned Judge concluded that the whole of the principal and interest payable according to the Act had been fully discharged and that nothing remained due by the judgment-debtors under the decree in suit No. 33 of 1938.

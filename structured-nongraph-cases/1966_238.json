A mere liability to satisfy an obligation by an assessee is undoubtedly not expenditure it is only when he satisfies the obligation by delivery of cash or property or by settlement of accounts there is expenditure. But expenditure does not necessarily involve actual delivery or parting with money or property. If there are cross claims-one by the assessee against a stranger and the other by the stranger against the assessee and as a result of accounting the balance due only is paid, the amount which is debited against the assessee in the settlement of accounts may, appropriately be termed expenditure within the meaning of s. 10(2)(xv).",

The settlements made by the Bank with its constituents were in their nature bilateral each constituent admitted his liability to repay the amount which had been advanced to him, and the Bank admitted liability to pay to the constituent the value of the jewellery pledged with it. When the Bank paid to the constituent the difference between the value of the jewellery pledged with it and the amount due by the constituent, the Bank in effect paid the value of the jewellery against payment by the constituent of the amount due by him.

The High Court was of the view that the petitioner before it had cited and produced instances of publications which were freely on sale on the bookstalls on the railway platforms to show that the material which was sought to be excluded or  grounds on obscenity, was hardly distinguishable from the other popular magazines of foreign and Indian origin. Reliance was placed on the provisions of clause 742 of the Indian Railway Code which established that a publication to attract the ban imposed by the Railway Board must have been previously prohibited by the Government. As the Railway Board was number authorised to exclude any publication from sale- on its own determination that it was obscene, it was held that the order which was made by that Board was without authority."

Applying that test they held that the sole surviving member of a Hindu undivided family did not succeed to the business of the family within the meaning of section 26 2 , as he was previously a part-owner of the business and there was no transfer of ownership. While it is undoubtedly true that a transfer of ownership is ordi- narily involved in cases of succession falling within sec- tion 26  2  or section 25 4 , it cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as an essential element of succession within the meaning of those provisions."

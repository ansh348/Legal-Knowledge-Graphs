The Court noticed the fact that the advocate appearing in the case relied strongly on article 181 of the Limitation Act and, thereafter, took notice of the fact that that article had, in a long series of decisions of most, if not all, of the High Courts, been held to govern only applications under the Code of Civil Procedure. The Court also dealt with the argument advanced 1 1953 S.C.R. 351. that the reason for holding that article 181 was confined to applications under the Code was that the article should be construed ejusdem generis and that, as all the articles in the third division of the schedule to the Limitation Act related to applications under the Code,"

Ltd. v Gopal Bhiva and Others1 , where the Court had to deal with the argument that applications under s. 33C of the Act will be governed by three years limitation provided by article 181 of the Limitation Act. The Court, in dealing with this argument held - In our opinion, this argument is one of desperation. It is well settled that art. 181 applies only to applications which are made under the Code of Civil Procedure,, and so, its extension to applications made under s. 33C 2  of the Act would not be justified. As early 1 1964 3 S.C.R. 709, 722-23. as 1880, the Bombay High Court had held in Rai Manekbai v. Manekji Kavasji1 , that art 181 only relates to applications under the Code of Civil Procedure in which case no period of limitation has been prescribed for the application, and the consensus of judicial opinion on this point had been noticed by the Privy Council in Hansraj Gupta v.

The High Court ignored the circumstance that the provisions of article 137 were sought to be applied to an application which was presented not to a court but 1 70 B. L.

Even if it may be assumed that the accused completed the rectification work in May 1966, that fact, in our opinion, would no absolve the accused of their criminal liability. The charge, against the accused relates to preparation of false documents because even though no work had been done till March 11, 1966 and no amount had been disbursed, they prepared docu- ments showing the doing of that work and the payment of that amount. It is no answer to, that charge that after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities, the accused in the month of May 1966 got the rectification work done. It is also no answer to a charge of criminal misappropriation that the money was subsequently, after the matter had been reported to the high authorities, disbursed for the purpose for which it had been entrusted. According to explanation 1 to section 403 Indian Penal Code, a dishonest misappropriation for a time only is misappropriation within the meaning of that section."

Nothing has been brought to our notice as to how an enquiry before the registration of a case can be held to be investigation. The matter, however, need no be dilated upon and it is no necessary to express any final opinion in the matter because we find that there is no material on the record as may show that the accused were prejudiced because of the alleged no-compliance with the provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act. It is well established that where cognizance of a case has, in fact, been taken by the court on a police report following investigation conducted in breach of provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the result of the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice."

The Act was passed to make provisions for the prevention of adulteration of food. Butter is a favourite edible fat and is consumed in different ways by innumerable persons in this country. As we have already pointed out, butter is prepared in the rural areas throughout this country by the indigenous process of churning soured milk, whereas only in a few cities butter is prepared directly from milk. The interpretation suggested by learned counsel for the appellant, if accepted, would make the rule a dead- letter, for all practical purposes, and the object of the Legislature would be defeated. In our view, the intention of the Legislature has been clearly expressed in the rule. We, therefore, hold that butter prepared from curd comes within the definition of butter in r. A.11.05 of Appendix B to the Rules."

It is, therefore, argued that the report on the face of it is incorrect and therefore should not be acted upon. There is an obvious fallacy underlying this argument. 18.32 per cent. of foreign fat is not a percentage in relation to the milk but only in relation to the fat Out of the fat in the milk,. the analyst says that 18.32 per cent. is foreign fat. In his own words, The butter fat in the sample contains 18.32 foreign fat. If that be so, there is no mistake on the face of the report.

But in this case, there was a conflict of view even, in the Bombay High Court as regards the question whether butter made from curd would be butter within the meaning of the rule. Indeed, it was brought to our notice, that on April 16, 1960, the Central Government made another rule amending rule A-11.05 by inserting the word curd in the definition of butter and the amended definition.reads, butter means the product prepared exclusively from milk, cream or. curd of cow or buffalo This must have been made to clarify the position in view of the conflicting decisions. In the circumstances, we think that a sentence of fine would meet the ends, of justice in the present case. We, therefore, set aside the sentence of two months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 250/- and instead sentence the appellant to pay a fine of Rs. 500/-"

As we have already pointed out, butter is prepared in the rural areas throughout this country by the indigenous process of churning soured milk, whereas only in a few cities butter is prepared directly from milk. The interpretation suggested by learned counsel for the appellant, if accepted, would make the rule a dead- letter, for all practical purposes, and the object of the Legislature would be defeated. In our view, the intention of the Legislature has been clearly expressed in the rule. We, therefore, hold that butter prepared from curd comes within the definition of butter in r. A.11.05 of Appendix B to the Rules."

It is, therefore, argued that the report on the face of it is incorrect and therefore should not be acted upon. There is an obvious fallacy underlying this argument. 18.32 per cent. of foreign fat is not a percentage in relation to the milk but only in relation to the fat Out of the fat in the milk,. the analyst says that 18.32 per cent. is foreign fat. In his own words, The butter fat in the sample contains 18.32 foreign fat. If that be so, there is no mistake on the face of the report.

The Income-tax Officer served a numberice, after obtaining the approval of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of Income- tax, reauiring the respondent companypany to show cause why an order under s. 23-A of the Income-tax Act, 1922, should number be passed against the companypany and after companysidering the objections raised by the companypany ordered on March 31, 1953, that the undistributed portion of the assessable income of the companypany as companyputed for income-tax purposes and reduced by the amount of income-tax and super-tax payable by the companypany in respect thereof, shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividend amongst the shareholders as at the date of the respective general meetings. This order was companyfirmed in appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. Several companytentions were raised before the Revenue authorities and the Tribunal challenging the companypetence of the income-tax officer to pass an order under s. 23-A includ- ing the companytention that the said provision was unconstitu- tional or ultra vires. These have been negatived by the Tribunal and also by the High Court and it is unnecessary to refer to those companytentions in these appeals as they do number survive for determination. To a reference made under s. 66 1  of the Indian Incometax Act, the Tribunal referred three questions to the High ,Court of Judicature at Madras. The third question, which alone is material in these apeals, reads as follows Whether the provisions of s. 23-A were companyrectly applied for the three relevant years? The High Court held that the respondent companypany was one in which the public were substantially interested, and there- fore the Income-tax Officer had numberjurisdiction to pass the order under s. 23,-A of the Income-tax Act for any of the three years and on that footing answered the question in the negative. Against the order passed by the High Court, with certificate of fitness the Commissioner of Income-tax has appealed to this Court. Section 23-A of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 before it was amended by the Finance Act, 1955, stood as follows Where the Income-tax Officer is satisfied that in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends by any companypany up to the end of the sixth month after its accounts for that previous year are laid before the companypany in general meeting are less than sixty per cent of the assessable income of the companypany of that previous year, as reduced by the amount of income-tax and super-tax payable by the companypany in respect thereof he shall,. . make with the previous approval of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner an order in writing that the undistributed portion of the assessable income of the companypany of that previous year as companyputed for income-tax purposes and reduced by the amount of income-tax and super- tax payable by the companypany in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividends amongst the shareholders as at the date of the general meeting aforesaid Provided Provided further Provided further that this sub-section shall number apply to any companypany in which the public are substantially interested or to a subsidiary companypany of such a companypany if the whole of the share capital of such subsidiary companypany is held by the parent companypany or by the numberinees thereof. Explanation.-For the purpose of this sub-section,-- a companypany shall be deemed to be a companypany in which the public are substantially interested it shares of the companypany  number being shares entitled to a fixed rate of dividend, whether with or without a further right to participate in profits  carrying number less than twenty-five per cent of the voting power have been allotted uncoiiditionally to, or acquired unconditionally by, and are at the end of the previous year beneficially held by the public  number including a companypany to which the provisions of this sub-section apply  "

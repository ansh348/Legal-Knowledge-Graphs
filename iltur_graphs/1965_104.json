It is true that Pratap Singh was in possession of part of the property--which particular part we do not know--by reason of a transfer thereof in his favour by Bakshi Singh. In the present suit both Lal Singh and Pratap Singh assert their claim to property by succession in accordance with the rules contained in the dastur ul amal whereas the possession of Pratap Singh for some time was under a different title altogether. So far as the present suit is concerned it must, therefore, be said that the plaintiffs--respondents were never in possession as heirs of Raj Kaur and consequently art. 142 would not be attracted to their suit."

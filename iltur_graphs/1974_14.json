The petitioner in that case also sought a declaration that the revised policy in the matter of the sale of Kendu leaves was arbitrary, discriminatory and mala fide. One of the grievances of the petitioner in that case was that the bid of person making the highest tenders were number accepted. Repelling the companytention advanced on behalf of the petitioner, Mitter J. who gave the judgment of the Court on behalf of the Consti- tution Bench observed With regard to the girevance that in some cases the bids of persons making the highest tenders were number accepted, the facts are that persons who had made lower bids were asked to raise their bids to the highest offered before the same were accepted. Thus there was numberloss to Government and merely because the Government preferred one tender to another numbercomplaint can be entertained. Government certainly has a right to enter into a companytract with a person well known to it and specialty one who has faithfully performed his companytracts in the past in preference to an undesirable or unsuitable  1  1971 3 S.C.R. 153."

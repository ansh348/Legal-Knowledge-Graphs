This argument was built upon the contention that under Entry 36 of List II of the Seventh Schedule only a law of acquisition could be made that the existence of a public purpose and an obligation to pay compensation are the necessary concomitants of compulsory acquisition of private property, and that, therefore, the term acquisition must be construed as importing, by necessary implication, the two conditions aforesaid. This Court held that the expression acquisition in Entry 36 of List II did not take in the concept of compensation and, therefore, the Acts could not be said to be bad for want of legislative competence."

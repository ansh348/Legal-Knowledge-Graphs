The Board found that pending a dispute between the parties the Collector, in order to secure the Government revenue had attached and taken possession of the property and retained possession of it from 1861 until October 1863 when in companysequence of the decree of the civil companyrt he delivered possession to the defendant and paid over to him the surplus profits of the estate after deducting the Government revenue and expenses. As the suit was brought in the year 1874 the period of 12 years had to companymence some time in 1862. The Board observed that it must be assumed that the Collector properly took possession for the purpose of protecting the Government revenue. It was the duty of the Collector whi1st in possession under the attachment, to companylect the rents from the ryots, and having paid the Government revenue and the expenses of companylection to pay over the surplus to the real owner. If the defendant was the real owner the surplus belonged  1  9 I.A. 99. to him but if, on the other hand, the infants were the right owners, then the surplus belonged to them.

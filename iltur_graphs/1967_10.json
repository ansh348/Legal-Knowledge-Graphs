In this case, the municipality prepared the assessment book for the year 1965-66 adopting the figure from the previous year under. 21. The Mills finally-complained on July 3, 1965 raising various objections regarding the jurisdiction and the validity of the imposition of property tax on the floor area method. These were over-ruled and the assessment was finalised by an order dated September 15, 1965. On September 17, 1965 the municipality issued a bill in respect of the assessment. The Mills filed a tax appeal on September 27, 1965. On October 7, 1965 a numberice of demand under r. 4 1  1  of the Taxation Rules was made on the Mills. A Writ Petition was filed in the Gujarat High Court being Special Civil Application No. 1155 of 1965 on October 16, 1965. This petition along with various other petitions filed by other textile mills was dismissed by a companymon judgment in Application No. 1365 of 1966 on May 5, 1966. On May 7, 1966 the municipality issued an order of attachment under r. 45 1  of the rules. The Mills filed another Writ Petition in the Gujarat High Court against the issue of the order of attachment, but this was dismissed in limine on July 18, 1966. It may be numbered that the Mills in companymon with other Mills had preferred an application for grant of a certificate under Arts. 132 and 133 of the Constitution against the dismissal of the Writ Petition on May 5, 1966 and such certificate was granted on June 20, 1966."

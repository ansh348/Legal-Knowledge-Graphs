The Government was asked when it was intending to take over the privately operated motor routes and its reply was really a matter of policy, namely that it was the policy of the Government to take over all the routes eliminating all private operators from April 1, 1961. This did no mean that even if, for example, the scheme was no ready or if the scheme put forth was found by the Government to be open to objection, the Government would still force through the taking over of the privately operated routes from April 1, 1961 This answer was merely an indication of the Governments policy, namely, that the Government was intending to take over all private operated routes from April 1, 1961 but whether in actual fact all the routes would be taken over on that date would depend upon so many circumstances including finance. It cannot be said that this announcement of the Governments policy in answer to a question put in the legislative assembly meant that the Government was determined whatever happened to eliminate all privately operated routes by April 1, 1961. We are therefore of opinion that the Minister cannot be said to be personally biased because this policy statement was made by him in answer to a question put in the legislative assembly. Another reason that is urged to support the personal bias of the Minister is that the Minister is said to have stated to certain persons that as the privately operated routes in the district of Ganjam which was his constituency had been nationalised he was determined to annihilate all the private bus operators in the district of Cuttack also. This allegation has been denied on behalf of the State. It is however urged that no affidavit has been filed by the Minister who alone was likely to have knowledge on this point. It appears however that the petitioners also have no personal knowledge of any such determination on the part of the Minister. Thy based their allegation on an alleged talk between the Minister and two citizens of Cuttack, namely, a municipal councillor and an advocate. No affidavit however of the two persons concerned has been filed to support this allegation. In the circumstances we are of opinion that it was no necessary for the Minister to file an affidavit for the allegation on behalf of the petitioners was also based on heresay and it has been contradicted by similar evidence on behalf of the State. It would have been a different matter if the two persons concerned had made affidavits from personal knowledge. There is therefore no force in this contention and we are of opinion that it cannot be said on the facts of this case that the Minister was biased."

It was in our opinion no necessary to give a fresh notice giving ten clear days as required by r. 8, for this adjourned date. Rule 8 only applies to the first date to be fixed for hearing. Thereafter if the hearing is adjourned, it is in our opinion unnecessary to give a further notice at all for the adjourned date."

The Government was asked when it was intending to take over the privately operated motor routes and its reply was really a matter of policy, namely that it was the policy of the Government to take over all the routes eliminating all private operators from April 1, 1961. This did no mean that even if, for example, the scheme was no ready or if the scheme put forth was found by the Government to be open to objection, the Government would still force through the taking over of the privately operated routes from April 1, 1961 This answer was merely an indication of the Governments policy, namely, that the Government was intending to take over all private operated routes from April 1, 1961 but whether in actual fact all the routes would be taken over on that date would depend upon so many circumstances including finance. It cannot be said that this announcement of the Governments policy in answer to a question put in the legislative assembly meant that the Government was determined whatever happened to eliminate all privately operated routes by April 1, 1961. We are therefore of opinion that the Minister cannot be said to be personally biased because this policy statement was made by him in answer to a question put in the legislative assembly. Another reason that is urged to support the personal bias of the Minister is that the Minister is said to have stated to certain persons that as the privately operated routes in the district of Ganjam which was his constituency had been nationalised he was determined to annihilate all the private bus operators in the district of Cuttack also. This allegation has been denied on behalf of the State. It is however urged that no affidavit has been filed by the Minister who alone was likely to have knowledge on this point. It appears however that the petitioners also have no personal knowledge of any such determination on the part of the Minister. Thy based their allegation on an alleged talk between the Minister and two citizens of Cuttack, namely, a municipal councillor and an advocate. No affidavit however of the two persons concerned has been filed to support this allegation. In the circumstances we are of opinion that it was no necessary for the Minister to file an affidavit for the allegation on behalf of the petitioners was also based on heresay and it has been contradicted by similar evidence on behalf of the State. It would have been a different matter if the two persons concerned had made affidavits from personal knowledge. There is therefore no force in this contention and we are of opinion that it cannot be said on the facts of this case that the Minister was biased."

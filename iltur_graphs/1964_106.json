        "surface_text": "In our view there is no substance in this contention. The question referred to the High Court posed a problem as to the liability of the respondent company to be assessed for the assessment year 1948-49. Two rival views were propounded before the Judge Revisions Sales Tax. One was that the rates applicable to the fictional turnover for the year of assessment were those prevalent in the year 1948-49 and for the purpose of assessment they had to be applied to the turnover in the same proportion in which they would have applied if the option had not been exercised. That was the contention of the Sales Tax Department. The contention of the assessee was that having opted for the turnover of the previous year, the rates applicable to the turnover would be crystallised on the first day of the year of assessment and any modification since the commencement of the year in the rates would be inapplicable. This Court in the Modi Sugar Mills Ltd.s case 1 accepted the contention raised by the assessee. But for the amendment, the question which was posed by the Judge Revisions Sales Tax would have to be answered as it was answered by the High Court. The Legislature has, however, amended the Act and has declared that notwithstanding the option exercised by the assessee the tax would have to be computed in the light of the rates prevailing in 1948-49 as if they were projected upon the turnover of the previous year. The Legislature has expressly stated that this rule will prevail as if it was in force during the assessment year and all assessments will be made in the light of this amended rule. In answering the question which was submitted by the Judge Revisions Sales Tax, therefore, the law enacted by the Legislature is the law found incorporated in s. 31 by Amending Act III of 1963."

        "surface_text": "In our view there is no substance in this contention. The question referred to the High Court posed a problem as to the liability of the respondent company to be assessed for the assessment year 1948-49. Two rival views were propounded before the Judge Revisions Sales Tax. One was that the rates applicable to the fictional turnover for the year of assessment were those prevalent in the year 1948-49 and for the purpose of assessment they had to be applied to the turnover in the same proportion in which they would have applied if the option had not been exercised. That was the contention of the Sales Tax Department. The contention of the assessee was that having opted for the turnover of the previous year, the rates applicable to the turnover would be crystallised on the first day of the year of assessment and any modification since the commencement of the year in the rates would be inapplicable. This Court in the Modi Sugar Mills Ltd.s case 1 accepted the contention raised by the assessee. But for the amendment, the question which was posed by the Judge Revisions Sales Tax would have to be answered as it was answered by the High Court. The Legislature has, however, amended the Act and has declared that notwithstanding the option exercised by the assessee the tax would have to be computed in the light of the rates prevailing in 1948-49 as if they were projected upon the turnover of the previous year. The Legislature has expressly stated that this rule will prevail as if it was in force during the assessment year and all assessments will be made in the light of this amended rule. In answering the question which was submitted by the Judge Revisions Sales Tax, therefore, the law enacted by the Legislature is the law found incorporated in s. 31 by Amending Act III of 1963."

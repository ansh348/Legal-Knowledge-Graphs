None can belong to two cadres of permanent District Judges and Sub Judges at the same time and therefore, a temporary Addl. District Judge is actually in the cadre of Sub Judges and cannot therefore belong at the same time to the cadres of District Judges, unless he is companyfirmed in cadre of District Judges.

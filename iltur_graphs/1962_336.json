This letter, as is obvious from the dates, was given after the loan had already been made. The contention of the Bank was that when Sankaran brought this letter and asked for additional loan of Rs. 5,000 the Bank refused to advance any further amount and declined to accept this letter of guarantee for Rs. 25,000 lest the Bank might be compelled to loan a further sum of Rs. 5,000. Sankaran then took back the letter and after some time brought it back with the figure 5 changed into O and the word five scored out. These corrections were not initialled either by Sankaran or by Anirudhan. The Bank, however, accepted this letter and kept it and sued Anirudhan upon it. The question is whether Anirudhans liability is discharged by the alteration in the document which alteration is not proved to have been made either by him or with his knowledge or consent."

Dr. Seiyid Muhammed argued the case for the Bank at our request and has rendered us great assistance. Now, the provision of the Negotiable Instruments Act on which the High Court relied in terms applied to a negotiable instrument which a letter of guarantee is not. The principle of that provision may however be of wider application. That principle has been formulated in Halsburys Laws of England, 3rd edn., vol. II, p. 370, in the following words An alteration made in a deed, after its execution, in some particular which is not material does not in any way affect the validity of the deed It appears that an alteration is not material which carries out the intention of the parties already apparent on the face of the deed It is not well settled that, this principle applies to instruments under hand also see ibid p. 380, f.n.

The Bank did not accept the guarantee up to that limit but wanted the figure to be corrected i.e., by insertion of Rs. 20,000/-.

It is also the law that if the custodian of the document makes or allows an alteration to be made while the document is in his custody he cannot sue upon it is his duty to preserve the document in the state in which he got it. In the present case, the document was not altered by Bank not with the Banks consent or connivance while the document was in its custody. The document was apparently altered either by Anirudhan or by Sankaran or by both. If it was altered by Anirudhan, or by him and Sankaran together, the document still remains the document of Anirudhan and the suit of the Bank based upon it is competent against him. If it was altered by Sankaran the question is whether the alteration was a material alteration to make it void against Anirudhan."

        "surface_text": "But it is not the Banks case that there was such a contract of guarantee. Its case was that the contract of guarantee was for Rs. 20,000/-. That contract is not supported by the letter of which alone the suit is based. If there was no contract as stated in the letter then no question of consideration to support it can possibly arise. Therefore it seems to me that the contention that the alteration was immaterial and did not affect the instrument so far as the appellant is concerned is to no purpose in the present case. The position may then be thus stated. We have a suit against the appellant based on a written contract to guarantee repayment of Sankarans dues to the Bank up to Rs. 20,000/-. There is no evidence of any verbal contract of guarantee. The appellant wrote a letter guaranteeing repayment of those dues up to Rs. 25,000/-. Sankaran also signed this letter but that signature is of no consequence to the question of guarantee which alone arises in this appeal for Sankaran could not guarantee his own debt and his signature would therefore only be evidence of his liability for the amount advanced to him by way of overdraft. Such liability, however, he had already undertaken by executing a promissory note for Rs. 20,000/- in favour of the Bank. His signature on the letter of guarantee therefore made no difference in the legal relations that have to be considered in this appeal. Returning now to the letter of guarantee written by the appellant, the Bank refused to accept that letter and, therefore, on the Banks own case no contract on its terms was ever made. That letter was altered without the consent of the appellant probably by Sankaran by substituting Rs. 20,000/- for Rs. 25,000/-."

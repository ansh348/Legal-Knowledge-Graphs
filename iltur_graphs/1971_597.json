According to the Websters New International Dictionary arrears means among other things that which is behind in payment or which remains unpaid though due. The- example given is of arrears of rent, wages or taxes. In Strouds Judicial Dictionary, third edition, it has been stated that the word arrears presupposes a time fixed for payment of a sum of money and the lapse of time thereafter without payment. It is a part of the general scheme of all sales tax laws that taxes become due the moment a dealer makes either purchases or sales which are subject to taxation and the obligation to pay the tax arises. Although the tax liability which comes into existence cannot be enforced till the quantification is effected by assessment proceedings the liability for payment of tax is independent of the assessment  See Kedarnath Jute Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income tax, Central Calcutta  1 . We have no doubt that the word arrears in respect of tax has been used in the sense of dues or what has become due by way of tax and that does number depend on assessment proceedings or quantification of the amount. We do number consider that the amounts due by way of tax are companyered by the residuary provisions i.e. S. 91 of the Act of 1956."

The Privy Council held that the deed was a valid endowment of the whole property to the temple and that the donor had no rights in it against either the idol or the managers. Dealing with the argument that in the hands of the female members of the grantors family liberty was given to the said members to enjoy half the income, Lord Haldane observed that If the income of the property had been large, a question might have been raised, in the. circumstances, as throwing some doubt upon the integrity of the settlers intention, but, as the entire income is only 800 rupees, it is obvious that the payment to these ladies is of the most trifling kind, and certainly not an amount which one would expect in a case of that kind. 2   1917  L.R. 44 I.A. 187, 190."

The question depends upon the construction of the will as a whole. In this particular case, though the will had provided that the property of the testator shall be considered to be property of a certain idol, there were further provisions which showed that the residue after defraying the expenses of, the temple shall be used by the testators legal heirs to meet their own expenses and it appeared that only a small proportion of the total income could be utilised for the idol whereas a large balance was available to the heirs. On these facts, it was held by the Privy Council that the intention disclosed by the document was that the heirs should take the property subject to the charge for the performance of the religious purposes named in the will. Lord Shaw, who delivered the judgment of the Board, cited with approval the earlier observations of Turner L. J. in Sonatun Bysack v. Sreemutti Juggutsoondree Dossee  2  . Turner L. J. had stated although the will purports to begin with an absolute gift in favour of the idol, it is plain that the testator contemplated that there was to be some distribution of the property according as events might turn out and that he did not intend to give this property absolutely to the idol seems to their Lordships to be clear from the directions  1   1921  L.R.

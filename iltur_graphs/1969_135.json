The agreement entered into between the plaintiff and Hetampal Singh does number show that the goods in question had been pledged to the plaintiff. The finding, of the High Court is that the grain was removed by the Government from the possession of the appellant without any force or fraud and the appellant handed over that grain to the Government in response to a communication from the Controller of Foodgrains. At numberstage he told the Government that he was a pledgee of the goods. The decision in Santi Sahu vs. Sheogulam Sahu 1 relied on by the learned Counsel for the appellant is of numberassistance to him because the agreement relied on in that case is materially different from the one before us. On an interpretation of that document the court came to the conclusion that it constituted a bailment for security and that it is a pledge within the meaning of s. 172 read with s. 148 of the Contract Act. That is number the position here. Therefore the High Court was fully justified in rejecting the claim of the appellant that he was a pledgee of the goods."

Therefore in the absence of any specific plea, that question cannot be gone into. We do number know the conditions under which Hetampal Singh was appointed as a licence holder. From the material on record, it is number clear whether the goods in question were taken possession of by the Government in accordance with the conditions of the licence granted to Hetampal Singh. Therefore it is number possible to decide whether under the circumstances of the present case, the plaintiff could have enforced his lien against the State. It is true that the plaintiff informed the Government that Hetampal Singh owed to him about Rs. 20,000/-. But from that circumstance we cannot come to the conclusion that while voluntarily parting with the possession of the goods, he reserved expressly or by implication his right of lien, if he had any. We do number think that the rule laid down in Balmukund and anr. vs. Jagannath 1 relied on by the learned Counsel for the appellant bears on the facts of this case. Under these circumstances it is number possible to uphold the appellants claim against the State. Therefore the appeal fails so far as the State is concerned. It is accordingly dismissed, as against the 1st defendant, the State of Madhya Pradesh."

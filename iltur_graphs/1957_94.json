Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (XXVIII of 1947) hereinafter called the U.P. Act and consequently the U.P. Government had no power to make the reference in question. Industrial Dispute is defined in s. 2 of the U.P. Act as having the same meaning assigned to it as in s. 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 hereinafter termed the Central Act. There this expression has been defined in s. 2 (k) to mean any dispute or difference between employers and employers, or between employers and workmen, or between workmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or non- employment or the terms of employment or with the conditions of labour, of any person. The controversy between the parties arose in the following circumstances Tajammul Hussain, respondent No. 3 was employed as a lino typist by the appellant company. He was dismissed on May 8, 1952, on allegations of incompetence under r. 12 (ii) of the Standing Orders of the appellant company. It was alleged that the dismissal of Respondent No. 3 was welcomed by his co-workers and other workmen in the employ of the appellant company and they made no grievance of it, nor did they espouse his cause. The case of respondent No. 3 was not taken up by any union of workers of the appellant company nor by any of the unions of workmen employed in similar or allied trades, but the P. Working Journalists Union, Lucknow, with which respondent No. 3 had no connection whatsoever, took the matter to the Conciliation Board, Allahabad. ... The controversy which arises in this case is whether a dispute between an employer and a single workman falls within the definition of industrial dispute as used in the U.P. Act."

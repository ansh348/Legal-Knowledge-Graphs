It is clear from a reading of this subsection that the person who has a right to appeal is the Commis- sioner of Income Tax and number the Income Tax Officer. It would be numbericed that the period of limitation starts from the date on which the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner is companymunicated to the Commissioner by him. It seems to us that, in this companytext, the Income Tax Officer, when he files the appeal under the direction of the Commissioner performs merely a ministerial function. But the question still remains whether there is any limitation on the power of the Commissioner to numberinate the Income Tax Officer who should file the appeal. One thing seems clear-- from the expression the Income Tax Officer and that is that the Commissioner cannot direct any Income Tax Officer. The expression the Income Tax Officer occurs in various sections of the Act. In our view, the expression denotes an Income Tax Officer having jurisdiction over the assessee or the matter."

It is clear from a reading of this subsection that the person who has a right to appeal is the Commis- sioner of Income Tax and number the Income Tax Officer. It would be numbericed that the period of limitation starts from the date on which the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner is companymunicated to the Commissioner by him. It seems to us that, in this companytext, the Income Tax Officer, when he files the appeal under the direction of the Commissioner performs merely a ministerial function. But the question still remains whether there is any limitation on the power of the Commissioner to numberinate the Income Tax Officer who should file the appeal. One thing seems clear-- from the expression the Income Tax Officer and that is that the Commissioner cannot direct any Income Tax Officer. The expression the Income Tax Officer occurs in various sections of the Act. In our view, the expression denotes an Income Tax Officer having jurisdiction over the assessee or the matter."

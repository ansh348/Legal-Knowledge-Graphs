In support of this companytention the learned companynsel relied upon the decisions in Gopal Chandra Bhattacharjee v. The Secretary of , State for India  1 , and Cheshire v. Bailey 2 . The rule of law upon which these decisions are based is that the liability of the master for the misconduct of the servant extends only to the fraud of his servant companymitted in the companyrse of his employment and for the masters benefit and that a master is, number liable for the misconduct of the servant companymitted for the servants own private benefit. It is difficult to appropriate how these cases are of any assistance to the Bank. Here, what the Bank wants to do is to fasten liability upon the Firm with respect to the amount for which it had drawn a cheque. Before the Firm companyld be made liable, the amount for which the cheque was drawn had to be shown to have been paid to the Firm. On the companytrary it was handed over by the Bank to its Potdar avowedly with the object of paying it to the firm of Manohardass jainarain, but was number in fact so paid by him. Assuming that he misappropriated the money how can the Bank seek to hold the Firm of the defendants liable? This is number a case where the defendants are seeking- to hold the Bank liable for a criminal act of one of its servants or employees. But it is a case where the Bank wants to fasten liability on the Firm for the criminal act of the Banks own servant. Such a proposition is insupportable in law. For, vicarious liability may, in appropriate cases, rest on the master with respect to his servants acts but it cannot possibly rest on a stranger with respect to the criminal acts of a servant of another. The principle on which the masters liability for certain acts of the servant rests is that the servant, when he companymits such act, acts within the scope of his authority. If the servant was number acting within the scope of his authority, the master would number be liable and it is the person who did the particular act, that is the servant, would alone be liable. If a third party sustains damage or loss by reason of an act of the servant, he can hold the servant liable and also if the servants act falls within the scope of his duties or authority, the master as well. That principle can obviously have numberapplication for founding a liability against a stranger from whom the servant can in numbersense be regarded as deriving any authority."

In support of this companytention the learned companynsel relied upon the decisions in Gopal Chandra Bhattacharjee v. The Secretary of , State for India  1 , and Cheshire v. Bailey 2 . The rule of law upon which these decisions are based is that the liability of the master for the misconduct of the servant extends only to the fraud of his servant companymitted in the companyrse of his employment and for the masters benefit and that a master is, number liable for the misconduct of the servant companymitted for the servants own private benefit. It is difficult to appropriate how these cases are of any assistance to the Bank. Here, what the Bank wants to do is to fasten liability upon the Firm with respect to the amount for which it had drawn a cheque. Before the Firm companyld be made liable, the amount for which the cheque was drawn had to be shown to have been paid to the Firm. On the companytrary it was handed over by the Bank to its Potdar avowedly with the object of paying it to the firm of Manohardass jainarain, but was number in fact so paid by him. Assuming that he misappropriated the money how can the Bank seek to hold the Firm of the defendants liable? This is number a case where the defendants are seeking- to hold the Bank liable for a criminal act of one of its servants or employees. But it is a case where the Bank wants to fasten liability on the Firm for the criminal act of the Banks own servant. Such a proposition is insupportable in law. For, vicarious liability may, in appropriate cases, rest on the master with respect to his servants acts but it cannot possibly rest on a stranger with respect to the criminal acts of a servant of another. The principle on which the masters liability for certain acts of the servant rests is that the servant, when he companymits such act, acts within the scope of his authority. If the servant was number acting within the scope of his authority, the master would number be liable and it is the person who did the particular act, that is the servant, would alone be liable. If a third party sustains damage or loss by reason of an act of the servant, he can hold the servant liable and also if the servants act falls within the scope of his duties or authority, the master as well. That principle can obviously have numberapplication for founding a liability against a stranger from whom the servant can in numbersense be regarded as deriving any authority."

In support of this companytention the learned companynsel relied upon the decisions in Gopal Chandra Bhattacharjee v. The Secretary of , State for India  1 , and Cheshire v. Bailey 2 . The rule of law upon which these decisions are based is that the liability of the master for the misconduct of the servant extends only to the fraud of his servant companymitted in the companyrse of his employment and for the masters benefit and that a master is, number liable for the misconduct of the servant companymitted for the servants own private benefit. It is difficult to appropriate how these cases are of any assistance to the Bank. Here, what the Bank wants to do is to fasten liability upon the Firm with respect to the amount for which it had drawn a cheque. Before the Firm companyld be made liable, the amount for which the cheque was drawn had to be shown to have been paid to the Firm. On the companytrary it was handed over by the Bank to its Potdar avowedly with the object of paying it to the firm of Manohardass jainarain, but was number in fact so paid by him. Assuming that he misappropriated the money how can the Bank seek to hold the Firm of the defendants liable? This is number a case where the defendants are seeking- to hold the Bank liable for a criminal act of one of its servants or employees. But it is a case where the Bank wants to fasten liability on the Firm for the criminal act of the Banks own servant. Such a proposition is insupportable in law. For, vicarious liability may, in appropriate cases, rest on the master with respect to his servants acts but it cannot possibly rest on a stranger with respect to the criminal acts of a servant of another. The principle on which the masters liability for certain acts of the servant rests is that the servant, when he companymits such act, acts within the scope of his authority. If the servant was number acting within the scope of his authority, the master would number be liable and it is the person who did the particular act, that is the servant, would alone be liable. If a third party sustains damage or loss by reason of an act of the servant, he can hold the servant liable and also if the servants act falls within the scope of his duties or authority, the master as well. That principle can obviously have numberapplication for founding a liability against a stranger from whom the servant can in numbersense be regarded as deriving any authority."

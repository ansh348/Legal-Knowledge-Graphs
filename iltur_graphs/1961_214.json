We are unable to accept this line of argument as correct. Sections 9 and 11 of the Act must be read together and it would be wrong to treat the right to practise given by s. 9 as dissociated from the functions, powers and duties of Mukhtars referred to in s. 11. The learned Advocate for the petitioners is reading the two sections as though one section gives an absolute right and the other section merely empowers the making of rules to effectuate that right. That, we do not think, is a proper reading of the two sections. It is worthy of note that under S. 9 itself a distinction is made between the right of a Mukhtar to practise in civil courts and his right to appear, plead and act in any criminal court. In express terms s. 9 gives every 1 1953 S.C.R. 1 Mukhtar the right to appear, plead and act in any criminal court it does not, however, give such an unlimited right in a civil court."

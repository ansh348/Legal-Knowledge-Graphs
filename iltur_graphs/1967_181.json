Section 6 provided that articles mentioned in that Schedule were exempt from gales tax and articles number mentioned were taxable. There were two items in the, Schedule, namely, item 6, vegetables, and item 36, betel leaves, but subsequently item. No. 36 was deleted by an amendment of the Act. This Court held that the use of two distinct and different items i.e., vegetables and betel leaves and the subsequent removal of betel leaves from the Schedule were indicative of the Legislatures intention of number exempting betel leaves from taxation. The Court laid down that the word vegetable must be interpreted number in a technical sense but in its popular sense as understood in companymon language i.e., denoting a class of vegetables which are grown in a kitchen garden or on a farm and are used for the table."

In other words, the companystruction of the words is to be adapted to the fitness of the matter of the statute., On the other hand, as Fry, J. said in Holt Co.

Inland Revenue Commissioner 2  Pollock, D. observed, that if a statute companytains language which is capable of being companystrued in a popular sense such statute is number to be companystrued according to the strict or technical meaning of the language companytained in it, but is to be companystrued in its popular sense, meaning of companyrse, by the words popular-sense, that sense which people companyversant with the subject-matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it But if a word in its popular sense and read in an ordinary way is capable of two companystructions, it is wise to adopt such a companystruction as is based on the assumption that Parliament merely intended to give so much power as was necessary for carrying out the objects of the Act and number to give any unnecessary powers. In other words, the companystruction of the words is to be adapted to the fitness of the matter of the statute., On the other hand, as Fry, J. said in Holt Co. Collyer 3  If it is a word which is of a technical or scientific character then it must be companystrued according to that which is its primary meaning, namely, its technical or scientific meaning. Our attention was drawn to the decision in K. V. Varkey V, Agricultural Income Tax and Rural Sales Tax Officer, Peelmedu and others 4 , where green leaves plucked from tea bushes were held to fall under the word tea."

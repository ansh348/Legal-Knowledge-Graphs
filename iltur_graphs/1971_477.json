Presence or absence of profit was no material but the activity must be of a commercial character in the course of trade or commerce. It was found that the assessee had no been carrying on business in the fair price shop. The High Court looked into the articles of association of the assessee and found no article empowering it to carry on business in fair price shop. The assessee had opened that shop only to provide an amenity to its workmen so that commodities may be made available to them at fair prices. According to the High Court if as a matter of fact, some profit accrued that would be wholly immaterial because the assessee never intended to run the fair price shop as a business having an element of commercial activity. Section 2 of the Act gives the definitions. The definitions of business given in cl.(d), of dealer as given in cl.(g) and of sale as given in cl.(n) are reproduced below (d) business includes any trade, commerce or manufacture or any adventure or concern in the nature of trade, commerce or manufacture whether or no any profit accrues from such trade, commerce, manufacture, adventure or concern. (g) dealer means any person who carries on the business of buying, selling, supplying or distributing goods, directly or otherwise, whether for cash or for deferred payment or for commission, remuneration or other valuable consideration and includes-"

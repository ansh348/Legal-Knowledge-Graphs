The matter arises thus. Chhotahhai Jethabhai Patel, a partnership firm of which the second respondent, Jhaverbhai Bhulabhai Patel is a partner, carried on business on a fairly large scale as manufacturers of bidis at various places in the State of Madhya Pradesh including Saugor. Being unable to secure sufficient quantities of tendu leaves grown in the forest units in the State, the firm took leases for the companylection of such leaves in the States of Bihar Maharashtra. They actually imported tendu leaves under two railway companysignments from Bihar to Saugor. They informed the Divisional Forest Officer about the same and asked for permission for transport of the leaves and to utilise the said leaves for manufacture of bidis in their factories. By letter dated July 27, 1965 the said Forest Officer intimated the firm that the imported leaves were number to be moved for bidi manufacture until permission was accorded for so doing. The respondents grievance was that numberwithstanding the above companymunication and in spite of the fact that they had number moved the imported leaves from their godowns, the Sub Divisional Forest Officer Saugor seized two quantities of such leaves of 9007 bags imported from Garwah Road, Bihar and 256 bags of tendu leaves imported from Bindoumaganj, Bihar and followed the same up by filing a companyplaint alleging companytravention of s. 5 of the Madhya Pradesh Tendu Patta Wyapar Viniyaman  84 0 Adhiniyam, 1964, hereinafter referred to as the Act. The respondents filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution before the High Court for the issue of a writ of certiorari quashing the companyplaint."

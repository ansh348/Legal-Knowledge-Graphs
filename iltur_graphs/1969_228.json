There it is number for them companyclusively to decide whether that state of facts exists, and, if they exercise the jurisdiction without its existence, what they do may be questioned, and it will be held that they have acted without jurisdiction. But there is another state of things which may exist. The legislature may entrust the tribunal or body with a jurisdiction which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of facts exists, as well as. the jurisdiction, and on finding that it does exist, to proceed further to do something more. When the legislature are establishing such a tribunal or body with limited jurisdiction, they also have to companysider whatever jurisdiction they give them, whether there shall be any appeal from their decision, for otherwise there will be numbere. In the second of the two cases I have mentioned it is erroneous application of the formula to say that the tribunal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding certain facts to exist, because the legislature gave them jurisdiction to determine all the facts. including the existence of the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends, and if they were given jurisdiction so to decide, without any appeal being given, there is numberappeal from such exercise of their jurisdiction."

He pointed out that the facts in that case show that though only five out of twenty-two workmen espoused the cause of the dismissed employee, it was held by this Court that five workmen could be considered to form a substantial or appreciable body of the workmen of the company and hence there was an industrial dispute giving power to the Government to refer the same for adjudication. Based upon this decision, the counsel urged that as it has been found in the present case that out of the total of sixty workmen, five have supported the cause of the workmen concerned, it must also be held that there has been an espousal of the dispute by an appreciable number of the employees of the company and that there is an industrial dispute, which was properly referred by the Government."

If the said decision is carefully read, it will be clear that the workmen therein relied on certain resolutions passed by all the employees of the company supporting the cause of the dismissed workmen. Further, there was also material on record to show that the cause of dismissed employees was taken up by a union. It was in view of all these circumstances, added to the fact that the management therein had not challenged those items of evidence, that this Court held in the particular circumstances of that case that there has been a proper espousal of the cause of the dismissed employees so as to make the dispute an industrial dispute.

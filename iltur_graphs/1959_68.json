As the question of intention is number a matter of direct proof, the Courts have from time to time laid down certain broad tests which would generally afford useful guidance in deciding whether in a particular case the accused had or had number mens area for the crime. So in cases of criminal breach of trust the failure to account for the money proved to have been received by the accused or giving a false account of its use is generally companysidered to be a strong circumstance against the accused."

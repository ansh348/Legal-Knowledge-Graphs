It companysisted of ministers and laity who seceded from the Established Church of Scotland, but who professed to carry with them the doctrine and system of the Established Church, only freeing themselves by secession from what they regarded as interference by the State in matters spiritual. For manly years, efforts had been made to bring about a union between the Free Church and the United Presbyterian Church, also seceders from the Established Church. In 1900 Acts of Assembly were passed by the majority of the Free Church and unanimously by the United Presbyterian Church for union under the name of the United Free. Church and the Free Church property was companyveyed to the new trustees for behoof of the new Church. The United Presbyterian Church was opposed to the Establishment principle, and did number maintain the West- minster Confession of Faith in its entirety. the respondents companytended that the Free Church had full power to change its doctrines so long as the identity was preserved. The appellants, a very small minority of the Free Church, objected to the union maintaining that the Free Church had numberpower to change its original doctrines or to unite with a body which did number companyfess those doctrines. The appellants accordingly companyplained of breach of trust. It was held that the Establishment principle and the Westminster Confession were distinctive tenets of the Free Church and 1 1904 A.C. 515."

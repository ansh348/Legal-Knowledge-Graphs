He admits that certain observations made by this Court towards the concluding portion of the judgment would indicate that this Court was not prepared to accept the contention sought to be urged before it. But, Mr. Sen says that as the contention was not permitted to be raised, the observations of this Court could be said to have been made merely in passing and at best be regarded as a tentative expression of its views. We think Mr. Sen is right in the sense that the question has been actually left open by this Court. But even so, we will have to consider whether the grounds upon which the previous decision rests would not be relevant for consideration in connection with the argument advanced by Mr. Sen. In so far as discharge of contract by reason of frustration is concerned there is no question of implying a term in the contract a term fundamental for its performance, as is done by the courts in England because we have here the provisions of s. 56 as well as those of s. 32 of the Contract Act.

He admits that certain observations made by this Court towards the concluding portion of the judgment would indicate that this Court was not prepared to accept the contention sought to be urged before it. But, Mr. Sen says that as the contention was not permitted to be raised, the observations of this Court could be said to have been made merely in passing and at best be regarded as a tentative expression of its views. We think Mr. Sen is right in the sense that the question has been actually left open by this Court. But even so, we will have to consider whether the grounds upon which the previous decision rests would not be relevant for consideration in connection with the argument advanced by Mr. Sen. In so far as discharge of contract by reason of frustration is concerned there is no question of implying a term in the contract a term fundamental for its performance, as is done by the courts in England because we have here the provisions of s. 56 as well as those of s. 32 of the Contract Act. This is what was held by this Court in the earlier case and that decision binds us."

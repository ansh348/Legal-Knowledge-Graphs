In companysidering an application under s. 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act the Tribunal has, it is true, to go into all the circumstances which led to the termination simpliciter and the employer cannot be permitted to say, that he is number bound to disclose the circumstances before the Tribunal. The form of the order is number companyclusive of the true nature of the order for it is possible that the form may be merely a camouflage for an order of dismissal for misconduct. It is therefore always open to the tribunal to go behind the form and look at the substance and if it companyes to the companyclusion, for example, that though in form the order amounts to termination simpliciter it in reality cloaks a dismissal for misconduct it will be open to it to set it aside as a colourable exercise of the power."

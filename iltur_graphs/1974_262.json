But this method, in our view, reverses the process and imposes unnecessary burden on this Court. What should have been done by the High Court, is number being done by this Court. It is only after sending for the records, getting the paper books prepared, hearing both parties in the appeal and after appreciation of the evidence that it may be held that in some cases the dismissal, in fact, was ultimately justified. In many cases the appeals were even allowed. Long avoidable delay thus ensues during which the person companyvicted entertains a doubt about his companyviction and has to suffer the anxiety caused thereby. We do hope and trust that the series of decisions over this long period disapproving of the practice of summarily dismissing by one word will be taken numbere of and this Court will number be ultimately burdened with such appeals arising out of summary dismissals which is really the function of the High Court at the first instance."

As explained by Lord Sumner in Barendra Kumar Ghose v. The King Emperor the leading feature of s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code is participation in action. To establish joint responsibility for an offence, it must of course be established that a criminal act was done by several persons the participation must be in doing the act, not merely in its planning. A common intention--a meeting of minds--to commit an offence and participation in the commission of the offence in furtherance of that common intention invite the application of s. 34. But this participation need not in all cases be by physical presence. In offences involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence of the offenders sought to be rendered liable on the principle of joint liability may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences where the offence consists of diverse acts which may be done at different times and places.",

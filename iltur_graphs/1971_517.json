Section 3 of the, Act authorises the Central Government to constitute a Committee called the Central Committee for Food Standards to advise the Central Government and the State Governments on matters arising out of the administration of the Act and to carry out the other functions assigned to it under the Act. Under s. 23 1 b of the Act the Central Government may, after consultation with the Committee and subject to the condition of previous publication, make rules defining the standards of quality for, and fixing the limits of variability permissible in respect of, any article of food. It is in exercise of this power that r. 5 was made authorising standards of quality of the various articles of food specified in Appendix B to the Rules. In view of this provision any article of food which does not conform to the standards specified in Appendix B to the Rules which under s. 2 1 of the Act is said to be adulterated because the quality or purity of the article falls below the prescribed standard or its constituents are present in quantities which are in excess of the prescribed limits of variability."

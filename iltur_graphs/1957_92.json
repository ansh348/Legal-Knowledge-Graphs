They then said In the case number before us the marriage and the Gowna ceremony took place in 1938 and the document was executed in March 1940, the lapse of time between the two is too great to describe the gift to have been made on the occasion of either the marriage or the Gowna ceremony. No authority had been placed before us supporting a gift by a widow to a daughter except at the time or on the occasion of marriage ceremony. The ante-nuptial promise cannot be regarded as a gift having been made on the occasion of the marriage. Had it number been for the provisions companytained in the Transfer of Property Act governing the Law of Gifts it might have been possible to companysider the gift as having been made on the occasion of the marriage, the implementation of which was subsequent. In view of the strict provisions of the Transfer of Property Act we can only companysider the gift to have been made at the time when the deed was executed and registered."

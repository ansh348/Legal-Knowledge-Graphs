All that the departmental authorities did and. that position continued throughout was that they picked up one of the assets of the assessee's proprietary business, namely, its goodwill and regarded that as the subject of gift having been made to the daughters, who were the other partners of the firm which came into existence by virtue of the deed of partnership. This approach is wholly incomprehensible and no attempt has been made before us to justify it. In our opinion the second question which was referred by the Tribunal should have been framed as follows Whether on the facts and in the circumstances any gift tax was payable on the goodwill of the assessee's business. If the answer be in the affirmative how much share in the goodwill was liable to such tax ? We reframe the question in the above terms. It is quite obvious that the answer to the first part of the question has to be in the negative and therefore there is no necessity of answering ,he second part of the question. Question No. 1 also does not arise and need not be answered."

All that the departmental authorities did and. that position continued throughout was that they picked up one of the assets of the assessee's proprietary business, namely, its goodwill and regarded that as the subject of gift having been made to the daughters, who were the other partners of the firm which came into existence by virtue of the deed of partnership. This approach is wholly incomprehensible and no attempt has been made before us to justify it. In our opinion the second question which was referred by the Tribunal should have been framed as follows Whether on the facts and in the circumstances any gift tax was payable on the goodwill of the assessee's business. If the answer be in the affirmative how much share in the goodwill was liable to such tax ? We reframe the question in the above terms. It is quite obvious that the answer to the first part of the question has to be in the negative and therefore there is no necessity of answering ,he second part of the question.

Similarly, for the quarter ending September 30. 1951, he claimed a deduction of Rs. 15,677/1/3. By two assessment orders passed under s. 12 2  of the Act, the Sales Tax Officer, Cuttack III circle, Jaipur, Orissa, determined the tax payable allowing the deduction of Rs. 2,40,000/- and Rs. 15,677/l/3, under s. 5 2  a  ii . The dealer filed appeals to the Assistant Collector, Sales Tax, challenging the assesment on grounds which are number relevant. The dealer later filed revisions against the decision of the Assistant Collector. While the revisions were pending, the legislature amended the Orissa Sales Tax Act, in 1957, by Orissa Sales Tax  Amendment  Act  Orissa Act XX of 1957 . The effect of this amendment was that revisions were treated as appeals to Sales Tax Tribunal, and it enabled the Government to file cross-objec- tions. The State of Orissa, in pursuance of this amendment, filed memorandum of cross-objections challenging the deduc- tion of Rs. 2,40,000/- and Rs. 15,677/l/3, on the ground that the dealer had number produced any declaration, as required under r. 27 2  of the Orissa Sales Tax Rules, 1947, as evidenced from the Check Sheet kept on record. The Tribunal upheld this objection and directed that fresh assessments be made. Certain other questions were raised before the Tribunal by the dealer, but as numberhing turns on them as far as these appeals are companycerned, they are number being mentioned. The Tribunal stated a case to the High Court and one of the questions referred to was whether the assessing officer was number wrong in allowing deduction of Rs. 2,40,000/- for the quarter ending on 30-6-51 and Rs. 15,677/1/3 for the quarter ending on 30-9-51 from the respective gross turnover of the applicant. The High Court, following its earlier decision in Member, Sales-tax Tribunal, Orissa v. Messrs S. Lal Co. Limited  1  answered the question in the affirmative. The State of Orissa having obtained special leave from this Court, these appeals are number before us for disposal. Mr. Ganapathy lyer, on behalf of the State of Orissa, has companytended before us that it is clear that r. 27 2  was number companyplied with, and, therefore, the Sales Tax Officer was wrong  1   1961  12 S.T.C. 25. in allowing the said deduction. The answer to the question referred depends on the companyrect interpretation of s. 5 2  a  ii , Co. and r. 27 2 . They read thus - s. 5 2  a  ii -sales to a registered dealer of goods specified in the purchasing dealers certificate of registration as being intended for resale by him in Orissa and on sales to a registered dealer of companytainers or other materials for the packing of such goods. Provided that when such goods are used by the registered dealer for purposes other than those specified in his certificate of registration, the price of goods so utilised shall be included in his taxable turnover."

The Tribunal upheld this objection and directed that fresh assessments be made. Certain other questions were raised before the Tribunal by the dealer, but as numberhing turns on them as far as these appeals are companycerned, they are number being mentioned. The Tribunal stated a case to the High Court and one of the questions referred to was whether the assessing officer was number wrong in allowing deduction of Rs. 2,40,000/- for the quarter ending on 30-6-51 and Rs. 15,677/1/3 for the quarter ending on 30-9-51 from the respective gross turnover of the applicant. The High Court, following its earlier decision in Member, Sales-tax Tribunal, Orissa v. Messrs S. Lal Co. Limited  1  answered the question in the affirmative. The State of Orissa having obtained special leave from this Court, these appeals are number before us for disposal. Mr. Ganapathy lyer, on behalf of the State of Orissa, has companytended before us that it is clear that r. 27 2  was number companyplied with, and, therefore, the Sales Tax Officer was wrong  1   1961  12 S.T.C. 25. in allowing the said deduction. The answer to the question referred depends on the companyrect interpretation of s. 5 2  a  ii , Co. and r. 27 2 . They read thus - s. 5 2  a  ii -sales to a registered dealer of goods specified in the purchasing dealers certificate of registration as being intended for resale by him in Orissa and on sales to a registered dealer of companytainers or other materials for the packing of such goods. Provided that when such goods are used by the registered dealer for purposes other than those specified in his certificate of registration, the price of goods so utilised shall be included in his taxable turnover. Rule 27 2 . Claims for deduction of turnover under sub-clause  ii  of clause  a  of sub- section  2  of section 5- A dealer who wishes to deduct from his gross turnover on sales which have taken place in Orissa the amount of a sale on the ground that he is entitled to make such deduction under sub-clause  ii  of clause  a  of sub-section  2  of section 5 of the Act, shall produce a companyy of the relevant cash receipt ,or bill according as the sale is a cash sale or a sale .on credit in respect of such sale and a true declaration in writing by the purchasing dealer or by such responsible person as may be authorised in writing in this behalf by such dealer that the goods in question are specified in the purchasing dealers certificate of registration as being required for resale by him or in the execution of any companytract Provided that numberdealer whose certificate of registration has number been renewed for the year during which the purchase is made shall make such a declaration and that the selling dealer shall number be entitled to claim any deduction of sales to such a dealer."

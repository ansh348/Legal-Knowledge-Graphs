This Court came to the conclusion that the sales in question occasioned the import and as such it is exempt under Sec. 5 2  of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, which says A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of the import of the goods into the territory of India only if the sale or purchase either occasions such import or is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods before the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India."

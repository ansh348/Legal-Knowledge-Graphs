Thus in the Bharatkhand Textile Mfg. case  1 , this Court in discussing the companysiderations that arise in such matters, said- there can be numberdoubt that before framing a Scheme for gratuity industrial adjudication has to take into account several relevant facts the financial companydition of the employer, his profit-making capacity, the profits earned by him the past, the extent of his reserves and the chances of his replenishing them as well as the claims for capital invested by him, these and other material companysiderations may have to be borne in mind in determining the terms of the gratuity scheme it appears also to be well recognised that though the grant of a claim for gratuity must depend upon the capacity of the employer to stand the burden on a long term basis it would number be permissible to place undue emphasis either on the temporary prosperity or the temporary adversity of the emyloyer.

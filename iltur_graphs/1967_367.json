It treats such a family as one unit equating the landowner and his descendants with an individual landowner depriving by such equation the descendant of the right to hold a ceiling area for himself. Prima facie, such a provision would infringe Art. 19 1   f  and Art. 31 and would be hit by Art. 13. Article 31-A, however, provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Art. 13, no law providing for the acquisition by the State of any ,estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Arts. 14, 19 or 31.

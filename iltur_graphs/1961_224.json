J., there observed at page 496 as follows- In its plain and natural meaning a vegetable clearly is wide enough to cover sugar cane but what is urged by the Advocate General is that we must not give it that wide meaning but must give it the popular meaning as understood by people who deal in vegetables or eat vegetables, and it is urged that from that narrow and restricted point of view sugar cane is not vegetable. This is a taxing statue and if in favour of that construction which gives relief to the subject. That was exactly the approch of the Sales Tax Tribunal and in our opinion that approach was a very proper one."

State of Madhya Pradesh this Court said the word vegetable in taxing statutes is to be understood as in common parlance i.e. denoting class of vegetables which are grown in a kitchen garden or in a farm and are used for the table. If that is the meaning of the word vegetables sugar cane cannot fall within entry 6 which relates to green vegetables. In Websters dictionary sugar cane has been defined as a grass extensively grown in tropical and warm regions for its sugar and in Oxford dictionary it is defined as a tall perennial grass cultivated in tropical and sub-tropical countries and forming the chief source of unmanufactured sugar.

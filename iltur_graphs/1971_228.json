The purchase by the Food Inspector from the accused of sugar for purposes of analysis is a sale under s. 2 13  of the. Act. Section 7 prohibits a person from selling adulterated article of food. Similarly, under s. 16 1  a  i  any person who sells adulterated food commits an offence and is punishable therein. ... Hence it must be held that the respondents are technically guilty of the offence with which they were charged and they have been wrongly acquitted by the High Court and the District Magistrate. But in view of the fact that the appellant has argued the appeal only as a test case and does not challenge the acquittal of the respondents, we merely set aside the order and judgment of the High Court."

It is clear from a perusal of S. 68C that it speaks of the State Government, the Official Gazette and the State Transport Undertaking, even though it is quite clear that inter-State schemes also come within the compass of the provision. Whatever the reason-it is not for us to ask why-the section, as it reads, merely requires publication in the concerned Official Gazette of the State whose undertaking initiates the project for nationalisation. The fact that for statutory construction the singular includes the plural, does not compel us to read the plural wherever the singular is mentioned. We are satisfied that the expression in the Official Gazette and the publication required therein, does not undergo a change in its semantics when the route concerned is an inter-State as against an intraState one. In the present case it was the U.P. Undertaking which proposed the scheme for nationalisation and the U.P. Gazette has carried the publication. The law asks for no more. The legal objection has therefore to be overruled."

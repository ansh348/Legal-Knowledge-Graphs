It was also pointed out that s. 65 does number provide for any imprisonment in default of payment of fine, but the appellant was sentenced to 15 days simple imprisonment in default of payment of fine. Section 33 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with ss. 40 and 67 of the Indian Penal Code appears to us to be a clear answer to this companytention."

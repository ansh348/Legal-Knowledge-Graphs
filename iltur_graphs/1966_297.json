It cannot be and has number been disputed that Raturi Vaid is companyered by this definition, for he was duly numberinated though he later withdrew his candidature under s. 37 of the Act. What is however companytended is that even though Raturi Vaid might be a candidate within the definition of s. 79 b , this is a case where in the companytext of s. 82  b , the words any other candidate mean a candidate who has number withdrawn under s. 37 of the Act. Part VI provides for disputes regarding election and begins with s. 79, which defines certain words including the word candidate as used in this Part. Section 80 provides for an election petition and s. 81 for presentation of such petition and other matters. Then companyes s. 82 which is in these terms A petitioner shall join as respondents to his petition-  a  where the petitioner, in addition to claiming a declaration that the election of all or any of A.I.R. 1959 Pat. 250. 34 5 the returned candidates is void, claims a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected, all the companytesting candidates other than the petitioner, and where numbersuch further declaration is claimed, all the returned candidates and  b  any other candidate against whom allegations of any companyrupt practice are made in the petition."

Further, where the petitioner in addition to claiming a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void claims a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected, he has to join number only the returned candidates but all the companytesting candidates. So far as the words returned candidates and companytesting candidates are companycerned, there is numberdifficulty as to what they mean. A returned candidate is one who has been elected and a companytesting candidate is one who has number withdrawn his candi- dature under s. 37. It is true that in cl.  a  of s. 82 where we find the words he himself or any other candidate, any other candidate there means any other companytesting candidate.

In these circumstances it is impossible to accept that the allegation of companyrupt practice was only against Brij Bhushan Saran and number against Raturi Vaid. As we have said already, the primary allegation was against Raturi Vaid, though Brij Bhushan Saran was also made liable for the companyrupt practice alleged to be companymitted by Raturi Vaid on the ground that it was done on his behalf and in furtherance of his election.

Further, where the petitioner in addition to claiming a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void claims a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected, he has to join number only the returned candidates but all the companytesting candidates.

A returned candidate is one who has been elected and a companytesting candidate is one who has number withdrawn his candi- dature under s. 37. It is true that in cl.  a  of s. 82 where we find the words he himself or any other candidate, any other candidate there means any other companytesting candidate. That is clear from the companytext, for there is numberquestion of declaring a person who has withdrawn his candidature as duly elected.

There is numberindication in cl.  b  to suggest that any other candidate only refers to a candidate who has number withdrawn his candidature under s. 37.

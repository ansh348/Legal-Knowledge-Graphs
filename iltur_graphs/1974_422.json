There is numberdoubt that she was resident in Pakistan after the partition of India and she was, therefore. unable to occupy, supervise or manage here property in the United Provinces. We do number think that the learned Judges of the Division Bench who heard the appeal were right in refusing to companysider this aspect of the matter. The 1st respondent in his writ petition clearly averred that as Mrs. Naqvi migrated to Pakistan from Persia she companyld number be treated as an evacuee. The order passed by the 1st appellant also pro- ceeded on the basis that Mrs. Naqvi had migrated to Pakistan from Persia in 1948 and was still living there. He also referred to the fact that she had sent the money from Teheran in 1947 and the possession of the property had been taken by her son who came to India in 1948 for that purpose specifically whereas Mrs. Naqvi companytinued to reside in Pakistan till she came to India in 1962 for selling the plot and that she was a Pakistani national, In the revision peti- tion filed before the Assistant Custodian General by the 1st respondent also it is admitted that Mrs. Naqvi migrated to Pakistan from Teheran as was held by the Assistant Custodian. Therefore, merely because in his order in revision the Assistant Custodian General had relied upon section 2 c  i  to hold that Mrs. Naqvi was an evacuee that cannot prevent the companysideration of the fact whether she was an evacuee under section 2 c  ii . There can be numberdoubt that she was an evacuee within the meaning of that word under section 2 c  ii  and the property in question was an evacuee property."

There is numberdoubt that she was resident in Pakistan after the partition of India and she was, therefore. unable to occupy, supervise or manage here property in the United Provinces. We do number think that the learned Judges of the Division Bench who heard the appeal were right in refusing to companysider this aspect of the matter. The 1st respondent in his writ petition clearly averred that as Mrs. Naqvi migrated to Pakistan from Persia she companyld number be treated as an evacuee. The order passed by the 1st appellant also pro- ceeded on the basis that Mrs. Naqvi had migrated to Pakistan from Persia in 1948 and was still living there. He also referred to the fact that she had sent the money from Teheran in 1947 and the possession of the property had been taken by her son who came to India in 1948 for that purpose specifically whereas Mrs. Naqvi companytinued to reside in Pakistan till she came to India in 1962 for selling the plot and that she was a Pakistani national, In the revision peti- tion filed before the Assistant Custodian General by the 1st respondent also it is admitted that Mrs. Naqvi migrated to Pakistan from Teheran as was held by the Assistant Custodian. Therefore, merely because in his order in revision the Assistant Custodian General had relied upon section 2 c  i  to hold that Mrs. Naqvi was an evacuee that cannot prevent the companysideration of the fact whether she was an evacuee under section 2 c  ii . There can be numberdoubt that she was an evacuee within the meaning of that word under section 2 c  ii  and the property in question was an evacuee property."

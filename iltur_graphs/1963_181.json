It will be recalled that the Standing Orders which have been certified under the Standing Orders Act became part of the statutory terms and conditions of service between the industrial employer and his employees. Section 10(1) of the Standing Orders Act provides that the Standing Orders finally certified under this Act shall not, except on agreement between the employer and the workmen, be liable to modification until the expiry of six months from the date on which the Standing Orders or the last modification thereof came into operation. If the Standing Orders thus become the part of the statutory terms and conditions of service, they will govern the relations between the parties unless, of course, it can be shown that any provision of the Act is inconsistent with the said Standing Orders. In that case, it may be permissible to urge that the statutory provision contained in the Act should over-ride the Standing Order which had been certified before the said statutory provision was enacted. Assuming without deciding that s. 2(kkk) may include the trading reasons as suggested by Mr. Banerjee, the definition prescribed by s. 2(kkk) is not a part of the operative provisions of the Act, and so, the argument that there is inconsistency between the definition and the relevant Rule of the Standing Orders does not assist Mr. Banerjee's case. If there had been a provision in the Act specifically providing that an employer would be entitled to lay off his workmen for the reasons prescribed by s. 2(kkk), it might have been another matter. The only provision on which reliance has been placed is contained in s. 25C and that, as we have already seen, merely takes in the definition of lay off inasmuch as it refers to the workmen as laid off and provides the manner in which compensation would be paid to them. An alleged conflict between the definition of lay off and the substantive rule of the Standing Orders would not, therefore, help the respondent to contend that the definition over-rides the statutory conditions as to lay off included in the certified Standing Order. Therefore, we do not think Mr. Banerjee would be entitled to contend that s. 2(kkk) of the Act is wider than the relevant Rule in the Standing Orders and should apply to the facts of this case."

If any case is not covered by the Standing Orders, it will necessarily be governed by the provisions of the Act, and lay off would be permissible only where one or the other of the factors mentioned by s. 2(kkk) is present, and for such lay off compensation would be awarded under s. 25C.

        "surface_text": "We are not prepared to accept the argument that in the present case, the respondent can rely on the definition of lay off as prescribed by s. 2(kkk). It will be recalled that the Standing Orders which have been certified under the Standing Orders Act became part of the statutory terms and conditions of service between the industrial employer and his employees. Section 10(1) of the Standing Orders Act provides that the Standing Orders finally certified under this Act shall not, except on agreement between the employer and the workmen, be liable to modification until the expiry of six months from the date on which the Standing Orders or the last modification thereof came into operation. If the Standing Orders thus become the part of the statutory terms and conditions of service, they will govern the relations between the parties unless, of course, it can be shown that any provision of the Act is inconsistent with the said Standing Orders. In that case, it may be permissible to urge that the statutory provision contained in the Act should over-ride the Standing Order which had been certified before the said statutory provision was enacted. Assuming without deciding that s. 2(kkk) may include the trading reasons as suggested by Mr. Banerjee, the definition prescribed by s. 2(kkk) is not a part of the operative provisions of the Act, and so, the argument that there is inconsistency between the definition and the relevant Rule of the Standing Orders does not assist Mr. Banerjee's case. If there had been a provision in the Act specifically providing that an employer would be entitled to lay off his workmen for the reasons prescribed by s. 2(kkk), it might have been another matter. The only provision on which reliance has been placed is contained in s. 25C and that, as we have already seen, merely takes in the definition of lay off inasmuch as it refers to the workmen as laid off and provides the manner in which compensation would be paid to them. An alleged conflict between the definition of lay off and the substantive rule of the Standing Orders would not, therefore, help the respondent to contend that the definition over-rides the statutory conditions as to lay off included in the certified Standing Order. Therefore, we do not think Mr. Banerjee would be entitled to contend that s. 2(kkk) of the Act is wider than the relevant Rule in the Standing Orders and should apply to the facts of this case."

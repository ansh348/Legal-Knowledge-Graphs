G. 1 holding that a Court would be justified in annulling a marriage if it was found that the marriage had number been and companyld number be companysummated by the parties thereto, though numberreason for numberconsummation was manifest or apparent. In that decision both the husband and the wife were perfectly numbermal and each charged the other as being responsible for number-consummation of the marriage. The Court held that without going into the question as to who was the guilty party, it was evident that the marriage had number been companysummated and companyld number be companysummated in future also. Accordingly the Court annulled the marriage for the reason that it was satisfied that quoad hunc et quoad hunc, these people cannot companysummate the marriage. The Court further held that the two people should number be tied up together for the rest of their lives in a state of misery. The position in the case before us is entirely different."

It was found that the plaintiff had obtained title to and possession of the suit properties comprised in B Schedule in the settlement of 1935. The suit was dismissed on the ground that the will  Exh. 3  clearly showed that the testator purported to cancel the arrangement by the deed of settlement of 1935 and had made bequests under the will to the plaintiff of some of the properties which had been settled on Mariamma and Mani in the year 1935. This attracted the rule contained in S. 180 of the Succession Act and since the plaintiff had elected to accept the benefit under the will he was not entitled to claim any right on the basis of the deed of settlement of 1935."

If at all the question of the doctrine of ,election and the applicability of section 180 of the Indian Succession Act comes into play, in my view, the election will really have to be made, not, by the plaintiff, but by really defendants one and two."

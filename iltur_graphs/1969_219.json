The question that arose for consideration was regarding the validity of an order of dismissal by an employer of an employee contrary to the standing orders. The learned Judge has expressed the view that a breach of the standing orders constitutes a breach of a statutory provision and therefore the order of dismissal is a nullity. It is not necessary for us to consider the correctness of that decision because the dispute between the parties in that case arose under Industrial Law and we have already pointed out that one of the exceptions to the Common Law is under Industrial Law where Labour and Industrial Tribunals have jurisdiction to compel an employer to employ a worker whom he does not desire to employ."

Nothing has been brought to our notice which would induce us to interfere with the companysidered order of the tribunal in this behalf. All the points that Sri Chatterjee has raised on behalf of the workmen have been dealt with by the tribunal and the conclusion it has reached is that halving regard to the circumstances, the workmen were number eligible to the tiffin allowance of annas eight per head per working day. All that we need say is that the companyrespondence between the workmen and the companypany shows that though the workmen were keen on the provision of a canteen before the tiffin allowance was granted by the award dated July 24, 1953, their keenness disappeared after the award. The companypany seems to have taken steps even before the award to start a canteen and pursued the matter vigorously after the award but the workmen started objecting to the arrangements made and some of the objections were fantastic. It seems that having been given the tiffin allowance they preferred to have it rather than go to the canteen.

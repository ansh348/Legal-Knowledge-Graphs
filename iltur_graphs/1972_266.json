The appropriate. Government itself is bound to companysider the representation as expeditiously as possible., The reason for im- mediate companysideration of the representation is too obvious to be stressed. The personal liberty of a person is at stake. Any delay would number only be an irresponsible act on the part of the appropriate authority but also unconstitutional because the Constitution enshrines the fundamental right of a detenu to have his representation companysidered and it is imperative that when the liberty of a person is in peril immediate action should be taken by the relevant authorities. No definite time can be laid down within which a representation of a detenu should be dealt with save and except that it is a companystitutional right of adetenu to have, his representation companysidered as expeditiously as possible. The detenu in that case made a representation to the State Government on June 23, 1969 and the same was rejected by the State Government on August 9, 1969. It was held that the Government was guilty of the infraction of the companystitutional provision because of inordinate delay in companysidering the representation. The petitioner was accordingly set at liberty."

In that case this Court held that article 22 5  of the Constitution envisaged a dual obligation of the Government and a companyresponding dual right in favour of a detenu, namely,  1  to have his representation independently companysidered by the Government, and  2  to have that representation, in the light of the facts and circumstances of the case, companysidered by an Advisory Board. It was observed that the said provision enjoined upon the detaining authority to afford to the detenu the earliest opportunity to make a representation."

Therefore Pallaniappa had either to confirm the disposition or dissent from it, and his conduct showed that he had confirmed it for he took out probate. Therefore it must be held that after probate was taken out the residue became the absolute property of Pallaniappa and lost its character as joint Hindu family property. Now it is clear from s. 180 that after the legatee elects to dissent from the will he must give up any benefits provided for him by the will.

A father in a Mitakshara family has a very limited right to make a will and Pallaniappas father could no make the will disposing of the entire joint family property, though he gave the residue to his son."

Therefore Pallaniappa had either to confirm the disposition or dissent from it, and his conduct showed that he had confirmed it for he took out probate. Therefore it must be held that after probate was taken out the residue became the absolute property of Pallaniappa and lost its character as joint Hindu family property. Now it is clear from s. 180 that after the legatee elects to dissent from the will he must give up any benefits provided for him by the will. This shows that election under s. 180 would only arise where the legatee derives some benefit from the will to which he would no be entitled except for the will. In such a case he has to elect whether to confirm the will or dissent from it. But where there is noquestion of the legatee deriving any benefit from the will to which he would no be entitled except for the will, the fact that he confirms the will and accepts what the will provides would no amount to election, for he would have in any case got what the will gave him. Thus election only arises where the legatee has to choose between his own property which might have been willed away to somebody else and the property which belongs to the testator and which the testator has given to the legatee by the will. The matter is brought out in Halsburys Laws of England, Third Edition, Vol. 14, at p. 588, para 1091 in the following words Where a testator by his will purports to give property to A which in fact belongs to B and at the same time out of his own property confers, benefits on B in such cir- cumstances B is no allowed to take the full benefit given him by the will unless he is prepared to carry into effect the whole of the testators dispositions. He is accordingly put to his election to take either under the instrument or against it. If he elects to take under the will he is bound and may be ordered to convey his own property to A if he elects to take against the will and to keep his own property, and so disappoints A, then, he cannot take any benefits under the will without compensating A out of such benefits to the extent of the value of the property of which A is disappointed. Following this principle the High Court held that as the property which the will gave to Pallaniappa would in any case have come to him as a member of the joint family, there was noquestion of election even by Pallaniappa in this case. This view appears to us to be correct."

        "surface_text": "It is urged on behalf of the appellant that s. 180 would apply to the facts of the present case for the property willed by Pallaniappas father was no his which he could will away as it was joint family property in which Pallaniappa who was the residuary legatee had also equal interest. Therefore Pallaniappa had either to confirm the disposition or dissent from it, and his conduct showed that he had confirmed it for he took out probate. Therefore it must be held that after probate was taken out the residue became the absolute property of Pallaniappa and lost its character as joint Hindu family property. Now it is clear from s. 180 that after the legatee elects to dissent from the will he must give up any benefits provided for him by the will. This shows that election under s. 180 would only arise where the legatee derives some benefit from the will to which he would no be entitled except for the will. In such a case he has to elect whether to confirm the will or dissent from it. But where there is noquestion of the legatee deriving any benefit from the will to which he would no be entitled except for the will, the fact that he confirms the will and accepts what the will provides would no amount to election, for he would have in any case got what the will gave him. Thus election only arises where the legatee has to choose between his own property which might have been willed away to somebody else and the property which belongs to the testator and which the testator has given to the legatee by the will. The matter is brought out in Halsburys Laws of England, Third Edition, Vol. 14, at p. 588, para 1091 in the following words Where a testator by his will purports to give property to A which in fact belongs to B and at the same time out of his own property confers, benefits on B in such cir- cumstances B is no allowed to take the full benefit given him by the will unless he is prepared to carry into effect the whole of the testators dispositions. He is accordingly put to his election to take either under the instrument or against it. If he elects to take under the will he is bound and may be ordered to convey his own property to A if he elects to take against the will and to keep his own property, and so disappoints A, then, he cannot take any benefits under the will without compensating A out of such benefits to the extent of the value of the property of which A is disappointed. Following this principle the High Court held that as the property which the will gave to Pallaniappa would in any case have come to him as a member of the joint family, there was noquestion of election even by Pallaniappa in this case. This view appears to us to be correct."

They take an interest in it by birth whether they are in existence at the time of partition or are born subsequently see Hindu Law by Mulla, Thirteenth Edition p. 249, para 223  2   4 . If that is so and the character of the ancestral property does no change so far as -sons are concerned even after partition, we fail to see how that character can change merely because the father makes a will by which he gives the residue of the joint family property  after making certain bequests  to the son. A father in a Mitakshara family has a very limited right to make a will and Pallaniappas father could no make the will disposing of the entire joint family property, though he gave the residue to his son. We are therefore of opinion,that merely because Pallanappas father made the will and Pallaniappa probably as a dutiful son took out probate and carried out the wishes of his father, the nature of the property could no change and it will be joint family property in the hands of Pallaniappa so far as his male issues are concerned. Further it is equally well settled that under the Mitakshara law each son upon his birth takes an interest equal to that of his father in ancestral property, whether it be movable or immovable. It is very important to remember that the right which the son takes at his birth in the ancestral property is wholly independent of his father. He does no claim through the father  see Mullas Hindu Law, Thirteenth Edition, p. 251, para 224 ."

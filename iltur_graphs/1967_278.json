That section reads as follows- In any legal proceeding whatever, as well civil as criminal, the production of a companyy of such declaration as is aforesaid, attested by the seal of some Court empowered by this Act to have, the custody of such declaration  or, in the case of the editor, a companyy of the newspaper companytaining his name printed on it as that of the editor  shall be held  unless the companytrary be proved  to be sufficient evidence, as against the person whose name shall be subscribed to such declaration,  or printed on such newspaper, as the case may be  that the said person was printer or publisher, or printer and publisher  according as the words of the said declaration may be  of every portion of every  newspaper  whereof the title shall companyrespond with the title of the  newspaper  mentioned in the declaration  or the editor of every portion of that issue of the newspaper of which a companyy is produced.  The term editor is defined in the Act to mean a person who companytrols the selection of the matter that is published in a newspaper. Where there is mentioned an editor as a person who is responsible for selection of the material s. 7 raises the presumption in respect of such a person. The name of that person has to be printed on the companyy of the newspaper and in the present case the name of Madane admittedly was printed as the Editor of the Maharashtra in the companyy of the Maharashtra which companytained the defamatory article. The declaration in Form I which has been produced before us shows the name of Madane number only as the printer and publisher but also as the editor. In our opinion the presumption will attach to Madane as having selected the material for publication in the newspaper. It may number be out of place to numbere that Madane admitted that he had written this article. In the circumstances number only the presumption cannot be, drawn against the others who had number declared themselves as editors of the newspaper but it is also fair to leave them out because they had numberconcern with the publishing of the article in question."

That section reads as follows- In any legal proceeding whatever, as well civil as criminal, the production of a companyy of such declaration as is aforesaid, attested by the seal of some Court empowered by this Act to have, the custody of such declaration  or, in the case of the editor, a companyy of the newspaper companytaining his name printed on it as that of the editor  shall be held  unless the companytrary be proved  to be sufficient evidence, as against the person whose name shall be subscribed to such declaration,  or printed on such newspaper, as the case may be  that the said person was printer or publisher, or printer and publisher  according as the words of the said declaration may be  of every portion of every  newspaper  whereof the title shall companyrespond with the title of the  newspaper  mentioned in the declaration  or the editor of every portion of that issue of the newspaper of which a companyy is produced.  The term editor is defined in the Act to mean a person who companytrols the selection of the matter that is published in a newspaper. Where there is mentioned an editor as a person who is responsible for selection of the material s. 7 raises the presumption in respect of such a person. The name of that person has to be printed on the companyy of the newspaper and in the present case the name of Madane admittedly was printed as the Editor of the Maharashtra in the companyy of the Maharashtra which companytained the defamatory article. The declaration in Form I which has been produced before us shows the name of Madane number only as the printer and publisher but also as the editor. In our opinion the presumption will attach to Madane as having selected the material for publication in the newspaper. It may number be out of place to numbere that Madane admitted that he had written this article. In the circumstances number only the presumption cannot be, drawn against the others who had number declared themselves as editors of the newspaper but it is also fair to leave them out because they had numberconcern with the publishing of the article in question."

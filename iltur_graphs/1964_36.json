This Court held by majority that the law of pre- emption on the ground of vicinage imposed unreasonable restrictions on the right to acquire, hold and to dispose of property guaranteed by Art. 19 1  f  of the Constitution and was void. It was pointed out that it placed restrictions both on the vendor and on the vendee and there was numberadvantage to the general public and. that the only reason given in support of it, that it prevented persons belonging to different religions, races or castes from acquiring property in any area peopled by persons of other religious, races or castes, companyld number be companysidered reasonable in view of Art. 15 of the Constitution. If this ruling applies the present appeal must succeed. Mr. C. Misra, who appears for Labh Singh attempts to distinguish Bhau Rams case 1 . He companytends that the earlier case was companycerned with a legislative measure whereas the.  1  1962 Supp. 3 S.C.R. 724. present case of pre-emption arises from custom. He refers to the decision in Digambar Singh v. Ahmad Said Khan 1  where the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has given the early history of the law of pre-emption in village company- munities in India and points out that the law of pre-emption had its origin in the Mohammedan Law and was the result, some times, of a companytract between the sharers in a village. Mr. Misra companytends that Arts. 14 and 15 are addressed to the State as defined in Art. 12 and are number applicable to custom or companytract as neither, according to him, amounts to law within the definition given in Art. 13 3  b  of the Consti- tution. He submits that the ruling of this Court does number companyer the present case and that it is necessary to companysider the question of the validity of the customary law of pre- emption based on vicinage. It is hardly necessary to go into ancient law to discover the sources of the law of pre-emption whether customary or the result of companytract or statute. In so far as statute law is companycerned Bhau Rams case 2   decides that a law of pre- emption based on vicinage is void. The reasons given by this Court to hold statute law void apply equally to a custom."

Baijnath Singh  1 . This Court held by majority that the law of pre- emption on the ground of vicinage imposed unreasonable restrictions on the right to acquire, hold and to dispose of property guaranteed by Art. 19 1  f  of the Constitution and was void. It was pointed out that it placed restrictions both on the vendor and on the vendee and there was numberadvantage to the general public and. that the only reason given in support of it, that it prevented persons belonging to different religions, races or castes from acquiring property in any area peopled by persons of other religious, races or castes, companyld number be companysidered reasonable in view of Art. 15 of the Constitution. If this ruling applies the present appeal must succeed. Mr. C. Misra, who appears for Labh Singh attempts to distinguish Bhau Rams case 1 . He companytends that the earlier case was companycerned with a legislative measure whereas the.  1  1962 Supp. 3 S.C.R. 724. present case of pre-emption arises from custom. He refers to the decision in Digambar Singh v. Ahmad Said Khan 1  where the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has given the early history of the law of pre-emption in village company- munities in India and points out that the law of pre-emption had its origin in the Mohammedan Law and was the result, some times, of a companytract between the sharers in a village. Mr. Misra companytends that Arts. 14 and 15 are addressed to the State as defined in Art. 12 and are number applicable to custom or companytract as neither, according to him, amounts to law within the definition given in Art. 13 3  b  of the Consti- tution. He submits that the ruling of this Court does number companyer the present case and that it is necessary to companysider the question of the validity of the customary law of pre- emption based on vicinage. It is hardly necessary to go into ancient law to discover the sources of the law of pre-emption whether customary or the result of companytract or statute. In so far as statute law is companycerned Bhau Rams case 2   decides that a law of pre- emption based on vicinage is void. The reasons given by this Court to hold statute law void apply equally to a custom."

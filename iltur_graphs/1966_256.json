The Commissioner of Income-tax disallowed this item to the extent of Pounds 8,000 and the question that the question that fell for determination of the Judicial Committee was whether this disallowance was justified. At page 269 of Report, the judicial Committee pointed out that the true issue that arises in cases like this is whether there was evidence before the magistrate on which he was entitled to refuse to hold it proved that the Pounds 10,000 had been exclusively incurred in the production of the assessable income and that assessment was excessive."

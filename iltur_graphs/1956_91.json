The question as to whether the interest of the judgment-debtor, Rajes, in this case is vested or contingent, is one not altogether free from difficulty. But it is well to notice at the outset that this point has not been raised in the petition filed by the judgment-debtor, Rajes, under s. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure. What is stated therein is merely the following Under the said deed of trust, the judgment debtor has nointerest in the property except that of a trustee and as such the decree holder cannot proceed for realisation of her alleged dues against the said property. The objection in this form is obviously untenable and has not been urged in any of the courts below. Indeed, if under the trust deed the judgment-debtor has a beneficial interest, it is not disputed that such beneficial interest would be attachable provided it is a vested interest and not a contingent interest."

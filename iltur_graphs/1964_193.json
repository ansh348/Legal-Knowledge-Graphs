What precise meaning should be given to the expression must naturally depend upon the context in which it is used but it does involve the element of anticipation.

The High Court quashed the order of the Government on the ground that the Government could not make such an order without giving an opportunity to the petitioner, who was affected by the order, to offer an explanation as contemplated by the first proviso to s. 36 of the Act."

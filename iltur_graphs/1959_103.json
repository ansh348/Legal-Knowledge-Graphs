This Court, however, held that it was quite a different matter to say that if he enters India without a permit he may on conviction for such offence be ordered to be removed from India. It was the order directing his removal from India which was held by this Court to be tantamount to taking away his fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 19 1   c ,  1  1954 S.C.R. 933. to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. It is clear, therefore, that so far as this Court is concerned it has already decided that to require an Indian citizen to produce a passport before he can be allowed to enter India may be regarded as a proper restriction upon entering India."

The wife died after the Finance Act, 1894, had companye into operation. The Court held that the estate duty was only payable on the one-ninth share of the excess of the trust fund over the specified sum and on the benefit which accrued to the children by the cessor of the annuity, since that was the only property passing on the death of the wife. Dealing with the question of law arising for decision Kennedy J. observed There is numberquestion that, looking to the substance of the disposition which is in question, as to 9600 pond the children took an interest on the death of testator which was 1901 2 K.B. 331. qua that sum a definite ascertained profit which vested in them"

Section 403 runs thus Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or companyverts to his own use any moveable property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. It is obvious that an owner of property, in whichever way he uses his property and with whatever intention will number be liable for misappropriaion and that would be so even if he is number the exclusive owner thereof. As already stated, a partner has, undefined ownership along with the other partners over all the assets of the, part- nership. If he chooses to use any of them for his own purposes he may be accountable civilly to the other partners. But he does number thereby companymit any misappropriation.

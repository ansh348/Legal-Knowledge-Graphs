Paragraph 2 of the memorandum states that the question of protection to be afforded in the matter of various service conditions to personnel affected by reorganisation was discussed with the State representatives at conferences held with them. After careful consideration of the views expressed at these conferences, the Central Government had decided that the conditions of service in regard to substantive pay of permanent and temporary employees, special pay, leave rules, pension, provident fund and dearness allowance applicable to personnel affected by the reorganisation immediately prior to the appointed day should be protected. But so far as conditions of service in regard to travelling allowances, discipline, control, classification, appeal, conduct, probation and departmental promotion were concerned it would not be appropriate to provide any protection in the matter of these conditions. That is stated in paragraph 3 of the memorandum. Paragraph 6 of the memorandum stated that in respect of conditions of service as had been specifically dealt with in the proceeding paragraphs of the memorandum, it would be open to the State Governments to take action in accordance with the decisions conveyed therein and so long as the State Governments acted in conformity with those decisions, they might assume the Central Government approval in terms of the proviso to section 115 7  of the States Reorganisation Act."

The facts of that case are as follows The assessee, who was a partner in a firm having 7 annas share therein, retired from the firm on July 1, 1954. Thereafter, he gifted Rs. 75,000 to each of his four sons, three of whom were minors. There was a reconstitution of the firm with effect from July 2, 1954, whereby the major son became a partner and the minor sons were admitted to the benefits of partnership in the firm. The question was whether the income arising to the minors by virtue of their admission to the benefits of partnership in the firm companyld be included in the total income of the assessee under section 16  3   a   iv  a provision similar to section 1 6  3   a   iii  The Tribunal found that the capital invested by the minors in the firm came from the- gift made in their favour by their father, the assessee. This Court overruling the companytention of the revenue came to the companyclusion that the companynection between the gifts made by the assessee and the income of the minors from the firm was a remote one and it companyld number be said that income arose directly or indirectly from the asses transferred. Hence I income arising to the three minor sons of the assessee by virtue of their admission to the benefits of partnership in the firm companyld number  1  1970 77 I.T.R. p. 27. be included in the total income of the assessee. The ratio of the decision is found at page 30 of the report. This is what the Court observed in that case The companynection between the gifts mentioned earlier and the income in question is a remote one. The income of the minors arose as a result of their admission to the benefits of the partnership. It is true that they were admitted to the benefits of the partnership because of the companytribution made by them. But there is numbernexus between the transfer of the assets and the income in question. It cannot be said that that income, arose directly or indirectly from the transfer of the assets referred to earlier."

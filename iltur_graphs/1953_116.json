As soon as he died, it was open to his successor to repudiate the lease and recover possession of the property on the ground that the alienation was number binding on the endowment. In the present case the immediate successor of the alienating Mahant companysented to the lessees companytinuing in possession of the property and thereby he might be treated as creating an interest in the lessee companymensurate with the period of his lifetime or the tenure of his office. After his death, however, his successor did number accept any rent from the lessee or otherwise treated the lease as subsisting and in 1932 he brought the suit for recovery of possession of the property against the successors of the original lessee on the footing that they did number acquire any title by the grant which, being unsupported by legal necessity, was number binding on the Math. This was number a suit by a landlord against his tenant it was a suit by the holder or manager of the Math to recover possession of Math property which was improperly alienated by his predecessor on the ground that the defendant became a trespasser as soon as the previous Mahant died and the plaintiff was entitled to recover possession on proof of his title."

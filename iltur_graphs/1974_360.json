Secondly, the Rules provide an elaborate procedure for counting of ballot papers. This procedure contains so many statutory checks and effective safeguards against trickery mistakes and fraud in counting, that it-can be called almost fool-proof. Although no hard and fast rule can be laid down, yet the broad guidelines, as discernible from the decisions of this Court, may be indicated thus The Court would be justified in ordering a recount of the ballot papers, only where  1  the election-petition contains an adequate statements of all the material facts on which the allegations of irregularity or illegality in counting are founded  2 . On the basis of evidence- adduced such allegations are believing that there has been a mistake in counting prima facie established, affording a good ground for and  3  the Court trying the petition is prima facie satisfied that the making of such an order is imperatively necessary to decide the dispute and to do complete and effectual justice between the parties."

The argument raised was that the powers of the appeal court under s. 423, Criminal Procedure Code are to reverse the order of acquittal or to order a fresh enquiry or a retrial etc. but not to order eviction. But this argument is untenable in view of the fact that in the Act there is a specific provision in s. 18 of the Act authorising the making of such an order by a court convicting a person of offences under s. 3 or s. 7 of the Act. The relevant portion of s. 18 is as follows- S. 18 Closure of brothels and eviction of offenders from the premises,-  1  ,and if after hearing the person concerned, the magistrate is satisfied that the houseor portion is being used as a brothel or for carrying on prostitution then the magistrate may pass orders-  a  directing eviction of the occupier within seven days of the passing of the order from the house A court convicting a person of any offence under section 3 or section 7 may pass orders under sub-section  1  without further notice to such person to show cause as required in that sub-section."

The next submission of Counsel for the appellant was that the High Court in appeal companyld number order the appellants eviction because that power only a Magistrate has under s. 18 of the Act. The argument raised was that the powers of the appeal companyrt under s. 423, Criminal Procedure Code are to reverse the order of acquittal or to order a fresh enquiry or a retrial etc. but number to order eviction. But this argument is untenable in view of the fact that in the Act there is a specific provision in s. 18 of the Act authorising the making of such an order by a companyrt companyvicting a person of offences under s. 3 or s. 7 of the Act."

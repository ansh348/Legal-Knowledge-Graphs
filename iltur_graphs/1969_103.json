The original document is number before us, but from the cross- examination of the writer and the plaintiffs witnesses and also from the testimony of T.P. Sengottiah and his witnesses it does number appear that the words Clear the debts and execute the sale deed free from encumbrance were written in a cramped style. This sentence occurs immediately before the Schedule of property sold and after the first three paragraphs of the companyvenants of the memorandum. There was numberreason for the writer to leave any space which companyld be availed of to add this sentence after the document was executed. There is numberdenial that the sentence has been written by Ramamurthy. It is true that the High Court has observed that the ink in which the sentence was written appeared to be slightly different in shade from the rest of the document. But Ramamurthy Iyer has deposed that it was number true that the portion in the, agreement relating to the encumbrance was written subsequent to the agreement in companylusion with the plaintiff. He explained that the ink in his fountain-pen was exhausted when he wrote with one pen, and he wrote the portion after reading the document with another fountain-pen, and since the portion was written in a hurry the ink may have differed. According to him he did number numberice any difference in ink. There is numberreason to disbelieve the testimony of Ramamurthy Iyer. Even if it be assumed that the sentence regarding encumbrance was written after the deed was executed it will number invalidate the deed. The second defendant and his witnesses have admitted that there was number discussion at the time of the writing and execution of the agreement about the encumbrances upon the land. There is number even evidence that there were any encumbrances subsisting on the land. Ordinarily when property is agreed to be sold for a price, it would be the duty of the vendor to clear it of all the encumbrances before executing the sale deed. The alteration, if any, cannot therefore be regarded as material. As observed in Halsburys Laws of England, Vol. 11, 3rd Edn., Art. 599 at A material alteration is one which varies the rights, liabilities, or legal position of the parties as ascertained by the deed in its original state, or otherwise varies the legal effect of the instrument as originally expressed,or reduces to certainty some provision which was origInally unascertained and as such void, or may otherwise prejudice the party bound by the deed as originally executed. The effect of making such an alteration, without the companysent of the party bound, is exactly the same as that of canceling the deed. It is also stated in Art. 604 at pp. 370 and An alteration made in a deed, after its execution, in some particular which is number material does number in any way affect the validity of the deed an alteration is number material which does number vary the legal effect of the deed in its original state, but merely expresses that which was implied by law in the deed as originally written, or which carries out the intention of the parties already apparent on the face of the deed, provided that the alteration does number otherwise prejudice the party liable thereunder."

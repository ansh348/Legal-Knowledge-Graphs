Inasmuch as he was number joined as a respondent, the petition was liable to be dismissed under s. 90 3  of the Act. This defect companyld number be cured by any amendment of the petition seeking to delete the claim for such further declaration and the Election Tribunal was clearly in error in allowing such amendment on the grounds disclosed in 1. A. No. 3 of 1957 or otherwise. In regard to the deposit of security, however, the position was quite different. According to the evidence given by K. Nataraja Mudaliar, head accountant in. charge of the Madurai Taluk sub-Treasury, the amount was kept in the Election Revenue deposit and the monies were at the disposal of the Election Commission also that the Election Commission or anyone Basappa v.

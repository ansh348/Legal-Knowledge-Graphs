As regards the sentence of fine, it is contended that since the deceased appellant was not sentenced to pay a fine only but was punished with a composite sentence of imprisonment and fine, the appeal would abate as regards the sentence of fine also. According to the learned counsel this Court may, at the highest, set aside the sentence of fine if it finds that the appellant need not have been asked to pay a fine.

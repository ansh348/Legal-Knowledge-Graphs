Commissioner of Income-tax, and the law was thus stated: The position that emerges on the authorities may thus be summed up: 1. When the point for determination is a pure question of law such as construction of a statute or document of title, the decision of the Tribunal is open to reference to the court under section 66(1). 2. When the point for determination is a mixed question of law and fact, while the finding of the Tribunal on the facts found is final, the decision as to the legal effect of those findings is a question of law which can be reviewed by the court. 3. A finding on a question of fact is open to attack under section 66(1) as erroneous in law when there is no evidence to support it or if it is perverse. When the finding is one of fact, the fact that it is itself an inference from other basic facts will not alter its character as one of facts."

The Assistant Collector of Central Excise by his order dated 13-12-1985 sanctioned the refund claim only partly. For the period from 1-4-1985 to 27-4-1985, the refund claim was rejected on the ground that the same was time barred. The Assistant Collector held that the refund claim for the period 1-4-1985 to 27-4-1985 was time barred for the reason that under S. 11B, the relevant date for preferring the claim for a case such as that of the appellant was the date of payment of duty and, according to him, the duty had been paid by adjustment in the personal ledger account as and when goods were removed. The plea of the appellant is that mere detailing in the personal ledger account should number be taken as the starting point for limitation and the relevant date should be the date on which RT-12 Returns which are filed on a monthly basis are assessed. The order of the Assistant Collector was companyfirmed in the appeal by the Collector of Central Excise  Appeals . The further appeal to the Tribunal was also unsuccessful. The question that arises for decision in the appeal is as to the starting point of limitation for filing an application under S. 11B of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944. S. 11B so far as it is material reads as under-- 11B. Claim for refund of duty.-- 1  Any person claiming refund of any duty of excise may make an application for refund of such duty to the Assistant Collector of Central Excise before the expiry of six months from the relevant date. Provided that the limitation of six months shall number apply where any duty has been paid under protest. Explanation -- For the purposes of this Section,--  A   B  relevant date means,--  a  to  d   e  in a case where duty of excise is paid provisionally under this Act or ihe rules made thereunder, the date of adjustment of duty after the final assessment thereof  f  in any other case, the date of payment of duty."

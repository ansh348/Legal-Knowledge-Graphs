Under these two clauses the members of the committee subsequently applied to the District Judge of Burdwan that certain directions might be given to the high priest the high priest opposed the application on the ground that it was in essence an application for modification of the scheme and could be entertained only by the High Court. The learned District Judge overruled this objection. The matter was again taken to the Calcutta High Court and that Court directed 1 that the committee must prepare ail annual budget of the income and expenditure 2 that provision must be made for quarterly audit and annual inspection of the accounts 3 that provision should be made for joint control of the temple funds after they have been realised 4 that there must be no undue interference on the part of the committee with the high priest in the internal management of the temple and 5 that no one who has any pecuniary interest in the temple properties or is a creditor of the endowment should serve on the committee. The High Court further directed that clauses embodying the aforesaid five directions should be inserted in the scheme. This decision of the High Court is reported in Umeshananda Dutta Jha v. Sir Ravaneswar Prasad Singh 2 . We now come to more recent events which gave rise to Miscellaneous Judicial Case No. 181 of 1953 in the 1 196 I.L.R. 3o Mad. 138. 2 1912 17 C.W.N. 871."

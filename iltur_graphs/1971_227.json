The first consists of Ordinances of the universities, and the second consists of the rules framed by the Government for selection of candidates for admission to the Pre-Professional B.Sc. Part I leading to M.B.B.S. degree,. The Ordinances framed by the three universities are made under the different Universities Acts setting up those universities and under the powers reserved to them under them. These Ordinances are made for the purposes set out in those Acts and for carrying out those purposes. One of such purposes would be the maintenance of certain academic standards in the various faculties taught in the college affiliated to the universities. For the purposes of maintaining such standards the universities lay down certain minimum qualifications for eligibility for entrance in those faculties. These Ordinances and regulations made under the Acts lay down the minimum qualifications required for eligibility and are not to be confused with rules for admission. A candidate may have the minimum qualification so as to make him eligible for entrance in a particular faculty. That does not mean that his being eligible necessarily makes him entitled to admission in that faculty, for, admission can only be commensurate with the number of available seats in such a faculty. The medical colleges in question are not university colleges but have been set up and are being maintained by the State Government from out of public funds. Since they are affiliated to one or the other of the three universities, the Government cannot frame rules or act inconsistently with the ordinances or the regulations of the universities laying down standards of eligibility. It is nobody's case that the Government has made rules which are in any way inconsistent with the rules for eligibility laid down in such ordinances and regulations. Since the Government has set up these colleges and maintains them, it has prima facie the power to regulate admission in its own institutions. Counsel for the petitioner pointed out to us no provision from the University Acts which deprives the Government of the power of making rules for admission in its own colleges. That being so, it cannot be said that the Government has no power to regulate admission in its own colleges or that because a student is eligible for admission under the University ordinances, he automatically gets a right to admission which he can enforce in a court of law. The rules are limited to admission to the Pre-Professional/ Sc. Part I Course leading to M.B.B.S. degree in the Government medical colleges and in respect of 59 seats in the aggregate in the medical colleges run-by private management. The control for admission in respect of the 59 seats in the private colleges must .have been acquired by the Government with the consent of or under some agreement with those colleges by reason of their getting financial and other aid from the Government. So long as the rules for selection applicable to the colleges run by the Government do not suffer from any constitutional or legal infirmity, they cannot be challenged as the Government can regulate ad- mission to its own institutions. The objection that it cannot, by such rules, provide for requirements over and above those laid down by the universities for eligibility cannot be sustained.  See Andhra Pradesh v. Lavu Narendranath  1  wherein the earlier decisions on this subject have been examined and followed."

The argument was that although there is one selection committee for all the Government medical colleges in all the three universities and for the said 59 seats in private colleges, students passing from colleges affiliated to a particular university are first admitted in Government medical colleges affiliated to that university and only seats upto 20 in each of such medical colleges can be allotted to outsiders in the discretion of the committee. The result is that a student having higher marks than the last admitted student is deprived of a seat only for the reason that he had passed his P.U.C. examination from a college affiliated to another university. According to counsel, such a classification has no rational basis and has no reasonable nexus with and C. As. 2161-A and 2161-B of 1970, dec. on Feb. 11, 1971. is in fact inconsistent with the very object of establishment of Government medical colleges, namely, to train in medicine the. most meritorious amongst the candidates seeking admission. In support of this contention counsel relied on Rajendran v. Madras  1  where rule 8 of the selection rules framed by the, Madras Government was struck down on the ground of its being violative of Art. 14. Rule 8 provided that the seats available in the general pool, as also those reserved for the socially and educationally backward classes would be allotted amongst various districts on the basis of the ratio of the population of each district to the total population of the State. The contention was that distribution of seats districtwise would result in denial of better candidates from being selected and candidates of inferior calibre getting selected only because they were born in that dis- trict where there were fewer candidates of good calibre. In defence of such a classification, two reasons were urged  1  that if districtwise classification was not provided, candidates from Madras city would get a larger number of seats in proportion to the population of the State, elbowing out candidates from the districts, and  2  if selection was made districtwise, those selected from a district were likely to settle down as practitioners in that district, so that the districts were likely to benefit from their training. It was conceded that Art. 14 permitted classification. But this Court rejected the justification for the aforesaid classifications urged by the State on the ground that the first meant that candidates from the districts, admitted to be of inferior calibre than candidates from Madras city, would stand a better chance of selection, a result defeating the very object of selection, namely, to get the best candidates, and the second on the ground that it was neither pleaded in the counter-affidavit of the State, nor had the State placed any facts or figures justifying the plea that students selected districtwise would settle down as medical practitioners in the respective districts where they resided. In Periakaruppan v. Tamil Nadu  2 , a rule which provided for distribution of seats unitwise and which set up different selection committees for each unit was held to be bad on the ground that it did not differ much from the districtwise distribution struck down in Rajendrans case  1 . Whereas formerly the distribution was districtwise, the system under attack established six units where, medical colleges were situate, namely, Madras city, Madurai, Chingleput, Coimbatore, Thanjavur and Tirunelveli. Though in theory the candidates had the liberty to apply for any one or more of those units, they were advised to apply to the unit nearest to, their residence and were also informed that even if they were to.  1  19682 S.C.R. 786.

As already stated, under cls. a  to  i  of r. 4, sixty, out of the present aggregate of 765 seats at the disposal of the Government, are set apart for the various categories of persons therein mentioned. As aforesaid, the Government is entitled to lay down sources from which selection for admission would be made. A provision laying down such sources is strictly speaking not a reservation. It is not a reservation as understood by Art. 15 against which objection can be taken on the ground that It is excessive. The reservation, as contemplated by Art. 15, is the one which is made under r. Under that rule, 15 reservation is for persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes, 3 for Scheduled Tribes and 30 for socially and educationally backward classes, that is to say, 48 in all against 690 available seats after deducting 60 seats set apart under r. 4. But, setting apart 15 seats under r. 4 g  for candidates who take up family planning programme does not constitute a reservation as any one of the lady candidates can take up that programme. Therefore, the seats available for distribution would be 720, 48 of which are reserved under r. 5. The question is whether such a reservation is unreasonably excessive. It was not disputed that under Art. 15 4  the State was en- titled to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes. It has to be remembered that the object of Art. 15 4  is to advance the interests of the society as a whole by looking after the interests of its weaker sections. But as stated in Balaji Mysore  1 , while making such a provision the rights and interests of the rest of the society are not to be absolutely ignored. Consideration for the rest of the society and those who are its weaker elements have both to be kept in mind and taking the prevailing circumstances as a whole have to be adjusted. The impugned provision in Balajis case  1  made reservation of 68 of the seats for the socially and educationally backward classes in medical and engineering colleges. Such a high percentage was held to amount almost to an exclusion of the deserving and qualified candidates from other communities, which also was not in the interests of the society as a whole. The Court there observed that in adjusting the claim of both the weaker and the stronger elements the reservation for the former should ordinarily be less than 50, although no inflexible percentage could be fixed and the actual reservation must depend upon the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case. In  1  1963 Supp. 1 S.C.R. 439. Periakaruppans case  1  41 reservation for the socially and educationally backward classes was held not to be excessive. No materials have been placed before us which would show that in the circumstances prevailing in Mysore State reservation made under r. 5 is unreasonably excessive. Setting apart 60 seats under r. 4 is as already stated, not a reservation but laying down sources for selection necessitated by certain overriding considerations, such as obligations towards those who serve the interests of the countrys security, certain reciprocal obligations and the like. The reservation, under r. 5, though apparently appearing on the high side, not having been shown as unreasonably excessive, the contention in regard to it must fail."

For comparison between herself and the said two candidates she took her marks in optional subjects only and apparently compared them with the total marks obtained by the said two students in the whole of the P.U.C. examination. There was thus no comparison between person equally situated even as regards the number of marks secured by them. But apart from that, the result obtained by a student in an examination held by one university cannot be regarded as comparable with the result obtained by another candidate in an examination held by another university. Even assuming that a conscious effort is made to equalise standards obtaining in different universities, such standards depend on several human factors, methods of teaching and examining, the syllabus in such universities etc. even though the subjects taught and examined were to be the same. It is well settled that a question of discrimination can only arise in the case of persons equally situated. That the petitioner and those whom the Selection Committee selected were equally situated cannot, from the facts above stated, be assumed. Consequently, the argument that r. 3. by prescribing the 10 years residence in Mysore State as a qualification for eligibility, is arbitrary and discriminatory becomes academic and need not be gone into in the present writ petition as the petitioner, even without insisting on that qualification, was not entitled to be selected."

The definition is couched in clear and unambiguous language, besides containing sufficient details, so as to distinctively identify the persons who would fall within it. ... In our view it is not unreasonable to extend that principle to the children of political sufferers who in consequence of their participation in the emancipation struggle became unsettled in life in some cases economically ruined, and were therefore, not in a position to make available to their children that class of education which would place them in fair competition with the children of those who did not suffer from that disadvantage. If that be so, it must follow that the definition of political sufferer not only makes the children of such sufferers distinguishable from the rest but such a classification has a reasonable nexus with the object of the rules which can be nothing else than a fair and just distribution of seats."

        "surface_text": "As seen earlier, there are two sets of provisions dealing with the teaching of medical courses. The first consists of Ordinances of the universities, and the second consists of the rules framed by the Government for selection of candidates for admission to the Pre-Professional B.Sc. Part I leading to M.B.B.S. degree,. The Ordinances framed by the three universities are made under the different Universities Acts setting up those universities and under the powers reserved to them under them. These Ordinances are made for the purposes set out in those Acts and for carrying out those purposes. One of such purposes would be the maintenance of certain academic standards in the various faculties taught in the college affiliated to the universities. For the purposes of maintaining such standards the universities lay down certain minimum qualifications for eligibility for entrance in those faculties. These Ordinances and regulations made under the Acts lay down the minimum qualifications required for eligibility and are not to be confused with rules for admission. A candidate may have the minimum qualification so as to make him eligible for entrance in a particular faculty. That does not mean that his being eligible necessarily makes him entitled to admission in that faculty, for, admission can only be commensurate with the number of available seats in such a faculty. The medical colleges in question are not university colleges but have been set up and are being maintained by the State Government from out of public funds. Since they are affiliated to one or the other of the three universities, the Government cannot frame rules or act inconsistently with the ordinances or the regulations of the universities laying down standards of eligibility. It is nobody's case that the Government has made rules which are in any way inconsistent with the rules for eligibility laid down in such ordinances and regulations. Since the Government has set up these colleges and maintains them, it has prima facie the power to regulate admission in its own institutions. Counsel for the petitioner pointed out to us no provision from the University Acts which deprives the Government of the power of making rules for admission in its own colleges. That being so, it cannot be said that the Government has no power to regulate admission in its own colleges or that because a student is eligible for admission under the University ordinances, he automatically gets a right to admission which he can enforce in a court of law. The rules are limited to admission to the Pre-Professional/ Sc. Part I Course leading to M.B.B.S. degree in the Government medical colleges and in respect of 59 seats in the aggregate in the medical colleges run-by private management. The control for admission in respect of the 59 seats in the private colleges must .have been acquired by the Government with the consent of or under some agreement with those colleges by reason of their getting financial and other aid from the Government. So long as the rules for selection applicable to the colleges run by the Government do not suffer from any constitutional or legal infirmity, they cannot be challenged as the Government can regulate ad- mission to its own institutions. The objection that it cannot, by such rules, provide for requirements over and above those laid down by the universities for eligibility cannot be sustained.  See Andhra Pradesh v. Lavu Narendranath  1  wherein the earlier decisions on this subject have been examined and followed."

        "surface_text": "The next contention was that r. 9 1 , which prescribes uni- versity-wise distribution of seats results in discrimination for it lays down a classification which is neither based on any intelligible differentia, nor has a rational nexus with the object of the rules. The argument was that although there is one selection committee for all the Government medical colleges in all the three universities and for the said 59 seats in private colleges, students passing from colleges affiliated to a particular university are first admitted in Government medical colleges affiliated to that university and only seats upto 20 in each of such medical colleges can be allotted to outsiders in the discretion of the committee. The result is that a student having higher marks than the last admitted student is deprived of a seat only for the reason that he had passed his P.U.C. examination from a college affiliated to another university. According to counsel, such a classification has no rational basis and has no reasonable nexus with and C. As. 2161-A and 2161-B of 1970, dec. on Feb. 11, 1971. is in fact inconsistent with the very object of establishment of Government medical colleges, namely, to train in medicine the. most meritorious amongst the candidates seeking admission. In support of this contention counsel relied on Rajendran v. Madras  1  where rule 8 of the selection rules framed by the, Madras Government was struck down on the ground of its being violative of Art. 14. Rule 8 provided that the seats available in the general pool, as also those reserved for the socially and educationally backward classes would be allotted amongst various districts on the basis of the ratio of the population of each district to the total population of the State. The contention was that distribution of seats districtwise would result in denial of better candidates from being selected and candidates of inferior calibre getting selected only because they were born in that dis- trict where there were fewer candidates of good calibre. In defence of such a classification, two reasons were urged  1  that if districtwise classification was not provided, candidates from Madras city would get a larger number of seats in proportion to the population of the State, elbowing out candidates from the districts, and  2  if selection was made districtwise, those selected from a district were likely to settle down as practitioners in that district, so that the districts were likely to benefit from their training. It was conceded that Art. 14 permitted classification. But this Court rejected the justification for the aforesaid classifications urged by the State on the ground that the first meant that candidates from the districts, admitted to be of inferior calibre than candidates from Madras city, would stand a better chance of selection, a result defeating the very object of selection, namely, to get the best candidates, and the second on the ground that it was neither pleaded in the counter-affidavit of the State, nor had the State placed any facts or figures justifying the plea that students selected districtwise would settle down as medical practitioners in the respective districts where they resided. In Periakaruppan v. Tamil Nadu  2 , a rule which provided for distribution of seats unitwise and which set up different selection committees for each unit was held to be bad on the ground that it did not differ much from the districtwise distribution struck down in Rajendrans case  1 . Whereas formerly the distribution was districtwise, the system under attack established six units where, medical colleges were situate, namely, Madras city, Madurai, Chingleput, Coimbatore, Thanjavur and Tirunelveli. Though in theory the candidates had the liberty to apply for any one or more of those units, they were advised to apply to the unit nearest to, their residence and were also informed that even if they were to.  1  19682 S.C.R. 786.

        "surface_text": "The last challenge to the validity of these rules was based on the allegation that they lay down excessive reservation for certain categories of candidates. As already stated, under cls. a  to  i  of r. 4, sixty, out of the present aggregate of 765 seats at the disposal of the Government, are set apart for the various categories of persons therein mentioned. As aforesaid, the Government is entitled to lay down sources from which selection for admission would be made. A provision laying down such sources is strictly speaking not a reservation. It is not a reservation as understood by Art. 15 against which objection can be taken on the ground that It is excessive. The reservation, as contemplated by Art. 15, is the one which is made under r. Under that rule, 15 reservation is for persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes, 3 for Scheduled Tribes and 30 for socially and educationally backward classes, that is to say, 48 in all against 690 available seats after deducting 60 seats set apart under r. 4. But, setting apart 15 seats under r. 4 g  for candidates who take up family planning programme does not constitute a reservation as any one of the lady candidates can take up that programme. Therefore, the seats available for distribution would be 720, 48 of which are reserved under r. 5. The question is whether such a reservation is unreasonably excessive. It was not disputed that under Art. 15 4  the State was en- titled to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes. It has to be remembered that the object of Art. 15 4  is to advance the interests of the society as a whole by looking after the interests of its weaker sections. But as stated in Balaji Mysore  1 , while making such a provision the rights and interests of the rest of the society are not to be absolutely ignored. Consideration for the rest of the society and those who are its weaker elements have both to be kept in mind and taking the prevailing circumstances as a whole have to be adjusted. The impugned provision in Balajis case  1  made reservation of 68 of the seats for the socially and educationally backward classes in medical and engineering colleges. Such a high percentage was held to amount almost to an exclusion of the deserving and qualified candidates from other communities, which also was not in the interests of the society as a whole. The Court there observed that in adjusting the claim of both the weaker and the stronger elements the reservation for the former should ordinarily be less than 50, although no inflexible percentage could be fixed and the actual reservation must depend upon the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case. In  1  1963 Supp. 1 S.C.R. 439. Periakaruppans case  1  41 reservation for the socially and educationally backward classes was held not to be excessive. No materials have been placed before us which would show that in the circumstances prevailing in Mysore State reservation made under r. 5 is unreasonably excessive. Setting apart 60 seats under r. 4 is as already stated, not a reservation but laying down sources for selection necessitated by certain overriding considerations, such as obligations towards those who serve the interests of the countrys security, certain reciprocal obligations and the like. The reservation, under r. 5, though apparently appearing on the high side, not having been shown as unreasonably excessive, the contention in regard to it must fail."

For comparison between herself and the said two candidates she took her marks in optional subjects only and apparently compared them with the total marks obtained by the said two students in the whole of the P.U.C. examination. There was thus no comparison between person equally situated even as regards the number of marks secured by them. But apart from that, the result obtained by a student in an examination held by one university cannot be regarded as comparable with the result obtained by another candidate in an examination held by another university. Even assuming that a conscious effort is made to equalise standards obtaining in different universities, such standards depend on several human factors, methods of teaching and examining, the syllabus in such universities etc. even though the subjects taught and examined were to be the same. It is well settled that a question of discrimination can only arise in the case of persons equally situated. That the petitioner and those whom the Selection Committee selected were equally situated cannot, from the facts above stated, be assumed. Consequently, the argument that r. 3. by prescribing the 10 years residence in Mysore State as a qualification for eligibility, is arbitrary and discriminatory becomes academic and need not be gone into in the present writ petition as the petitioner, even without insisting on that qualification, was not entitled to be selected."

The rule contains the definition of a political sufferer as meaning a person who on account of participation in the national movement for the emancipation of India had suffered imprisonment or detention for a period of at least six months, or had been awarded capital punishment, or had died while undergoing imprisonment or detention or was killed or became permanently incapacitated by police or military firing or lathi charge, or lost his job, property or other means of livelihood. The definition is couched in clear and unambiguous language, besides containing sufficient details, so as to distinctively identify the persons who would fall within it. ... In our view it is not unreasonable to extend that principle to the children of political sufferers who in consequence of their participation in the emancipation struggle became unsettled in life in some cases economically ruined, and were therefore, not in a position to make available to their children that class of education which would place them in fair competition with the children of those who did not suffer from that disadvantage. If that be so, it must follow that the definition of political sufferer not only makes the children of such sufferers distinguishable from the rest but such a classification has a reasonable nexus with the object of the rules which can be nothing else than a fair and just distribution of seats."

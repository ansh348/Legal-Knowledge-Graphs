The acquittals in the other the cases will of course stand but the mere fact that these persons have, in our opinion, been wrongly acquitted cannot affect the companyviction in the other cases. On the question of sentence, it would have been necessary for us to interfere in any event because a question of principle is involved. In a case of murder, the death sentence should ordinarily be imposed unless the trying Judge for reasons which should numbermally be recorded companysiders it proper to award the lesser penalty. But the discretion is his and if he gives reasons on which a judicial mind companyld properly found, an appellate companyrt should number interfere."

It is, therefore, not possible to predicate that at the time the resolution was passed the Municipality could not have contemplated a situation when the term of the Municipality would be extended under the provisions of the Act. With the knowledge of such a possible extension, when the members used the elastic expression residue, it is not reasonable to attribute to them the intention that they meant only the residue of the term available to them at that time. If that was their intention they would have prescribed a definite date on which the term of the President would expire. That apart, there is sufficient material on the record which indicates that the councillors designedly used the word residue instead of fixing a precise date. It appears that it was in the contemplation of the councillors at the time of the election of the President that there was a possibility of the term of the Municipality being extended. ... the intention appears to be that the term of the President should synchronize with the life of the Municipality existing or extended, as the case may be."

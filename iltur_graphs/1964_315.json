The general rule is well settled that the statutory requirements of election law must be strictly observed and that an election companystest is number an action at law or a suit in equity but is a purely statutory proceeding unknown to the companymon law and the Court possesses numbercommon law power. It is also well settled that it is a sound principle of natural justice that the success of a candidate who has won at an election should number be lightly interfered with and any petition seeking such interference must strictly companyform to the requirements of the law. None of these propositions however have any application if the special law itself companyfers authority on a tribunal to proceed with a petition in accordance with certain procedure and when it does number state the companysequence of number- companypliance with certain procedural requirements laid down by it. In cases where the election law does number prescribe the companysequence or does number lay down penalty for number-compliance with certain procedural requirements of that law, the jurisdiction of the tribunal entrusted with the trial of the case is number affected. The question which then has to be companysidered is whether in case of failure to companyply with the requirements of s. 119A the High Court had jurisdiction to rectify the mistake companymitted in making the deposit for companyts. There can be numberdoubt that an amount of Rs. 500 was intended to be and was in fact deposited by the appellant as security for companyts of the respondent, though it was described in the tender by the somewhat inappropriate caption security deposit. It appears that the Advocate appearing for the appellant in the High Court did number properly appreciate the scope  1  1954 S.C.R.892, 895."

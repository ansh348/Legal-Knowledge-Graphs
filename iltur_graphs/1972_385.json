However erroneous they may be, according to Shri Bhandare, it is not the practice of this Court to interfere with such conclusions. In our view, the Tribunal has not only made some contradictory observations about the practice prevailing in the other projects of the Oil Natural Gas Commission but has also misread the statement of Shri Hasan (M.W. 1). It has indeed wrongly interfered with the appellants decision in fixing the hours of work which was fully within its competence, and was not open to any valid objection. The conclusions of the Tribunal are, therefore, tainted with serious infirmity justifying re-appraisal of the evidence by this Court for coming to its own independent conclusion on such reappraisal."

In our view, the Tribunal has not only made some contradictory observations about the practice prevailing in the other projects of the Oil Natural Gas Commission but has also misread the statement of Shri Hasan (M.W. 1). It has indeed wrongly interfered with the appellants decision in fixing the hours of work which was fully within its competence, and was not open to any valid objection. The conclusions of the Tribunal are, therefore, tainted with serious infirmity justifying re-appraisal of the evidence by this Court for coming to its own independent conclusion on such reappraisal."

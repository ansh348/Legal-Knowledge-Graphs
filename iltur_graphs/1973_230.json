Governments view on the issue was revealed in answer to an interpellation in the Legislative Council made on March 17, 1973. On this-reckoning the Chairmans term would have ended on the 19th and so, the panicked respondent hastened to the High Court to avert the peril of premature ouster and sought an appropriate writ interdicting Governments move. The timely interim order and the eventual allowance of the writ petition balked the hope of Government and drove the State to this Court in quest of a final pronouncement on the companystitutional question involved. While there is divergence of judicial opinion at the High Court level, the preponderance of authority, including a ruling of the Mysore High Court itself, militates against the appellants stand- point. A broad companysensus of administrative practice evolved by the Union Government in response to an opinion tendered by the Attorney General on a reference made to him at the instance of the Conference of All India Chairmen of Public Service Commissions  prompted by divergent views expressed in a full Bench judgment of the Calcutta High, Court  also goes against the appellants position. Technically, neither the appellant number, for that matter, any citizen is bound by administrative verdicts on questions of law and when the High Courts disagree, the law becomes uncertain necessitating resolution of the companyflict by the Supreme Court. It is apt to remember the words of Rich, J- One of the tasks of this Court is to preserve uniformity of determination. It may, be that in performing the task the Court does number achieve the uniformity that was desirable and what uniformity is achieved may be uniformity of error. However in that event it is at least uniformity.  1  Moreover, in a Government of laws like ours, the last companyrt has the last word on a given law, it being permissible to the Legislature, subject to companystitutional limitations, to amend the law, if necessary. The question in the present case being one of general public importance has to be decided by this Court silencing the present and potential disputes and laying down a binding rule for the whole companyntry. Counsel for the appellant strenuously companytends that there is high policy animating the provisions, which limit the official life of a Member of the Public Service Commission to a significantly short term of six years companypled with an almost blanket ban on the holding Waghorn v. Waghorn, 65 Commw. L. R. 239, 293  1942 . of other office or taking up of other employment under Government on ceasing to be a Member. Before, we focus on the fasciculus of Articles 316 to 319 to assess the force of this and other submissions, two basic questions fall to be companysidered. Is there any public policy of great moment behind these Articles and if so, what is it ? Secondly, assuming its existence and importance, companyld this Court, while interpreting the provisions of the Constitution, listen to such extrinsic voices, however natural logical and persuasive or be guided by the olden rule of grammatical companystruction which treats the text of the statute as a sort of forensic sound-proof room ? The working life, of an Indian official in administration can easily be, and is, several times the six short years granted to a Public Service Commission Member under Art. 316 2 . Further employment in public service is also number unusual for superannuated officers, particularly at the higher echelons. And yet there is substantial, although number total, prohibition of subsequent employment in public service of Commission Members written into the Constitution by Art. 319. The learned companynsel rightly stresses that the Public Service Commission has vast powers of recruitment of candidates for an immense and increasing host of Government posts which in a companyntry with companysiderable unemployment are prom to be abused if too close and too long a familiarity with certain sectors were to be established. The prospect and peril of the Executive, tempting with renewals of membership to influence the incumbents may companyrupt that institution, which must zealously be kept above suspicion. This is the reason detre of the narrow period prescribed by Art. 316 2 , the taboo on reappointment in Art. 316 3  and on taking up of any Government service clamped down by Art."

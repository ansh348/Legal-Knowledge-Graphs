In that case, the majority decision of this Court held that the power of reservation which is conferred on the State under Art. 16 4  can be exercised by the State, in a proper case number only by providing for reservation of appointments, but also by providing for reservation of selection posts. This conclusion was reached on the basis that it served to give effect to the intention of the Constitution-makers to make adequate safeguards for the advancement of Backward Classes and to secure their adequate representation in the Services."

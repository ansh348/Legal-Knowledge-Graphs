It is important that the terms of the section are strictly companyplied with because the right of appeal of the accused depends upon the circumstance whether lie pleaded guilty or number and it is for this reason that the legislature requires that the exact words used by the accused in his plea of guilty should, as nearly as possible, be recorded in his own language in order to prevent any mistake or misapprehension.

Erugadu 1 that the violation of the procedure in s. 243 of the Criminal Procedure Code was sufficiently serious to invalidate the companyviction of the accused.

Though, it was submitted by Mr. K.T.S. Tulsi that higher sentences would have been more appropriate in respect of established offences, we do number think it necessary to go into that question in absence of an appeal by the prosecution in that regard. The appeal filed by the State is accordingly dismissed. In the result, all the seven appeals stand dismissed."

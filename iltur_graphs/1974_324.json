The definition itself sets out the primary purposes for which a trade union can be formed. The objects of the Association listed under Rule 3 include the following To regulate terms and conditions of employment in the Mills and Factories. To promote good relations between the employers and the employees. To adjust controversies between members of this Association. To establish just and equitable principles in trade and impose restrictive conditions on the conduct of sugar trade and business. These are all primary purposes of a Trade Union. Rule 3 b also may possibly be. taken as a trade union object. Assuming Rule 3 a could be the primary object of a trade union, the other objects named in clauses c , d , l and n of Rule 3 also fall in the same category, and it is not possible to speak of one of them as ancillary or incidental to another. These other objects cannot also be called charitable purposes within the meaning of section 4 3 i , even assuming that in some remote and indirect manner they might be of some public utility."

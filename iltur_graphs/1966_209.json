One of the illustrations given at p. 627 is relevant to the present enquiry and that is as follows if a law lays down principles which are not relevant to the property acquired or to the value of the property at or about the time it is acquired, it may be said that they are not principles contemplated by Art. 31(2) of the Constitution. If a law says that though it house is acquired in 1960 its value in 1930 should be given the principles do not pertain to the domain of adequacy but are principles unconnected to the value of the property acquired."

Further, observed the High Court, compensation for loss of land being determined under s. 67 of the Act only on the basis of the market value at the date of declaration of intention to make the scheme and not the market value at the date on which the scheme comes into force, the Act does not give for the original plot of land of the owner a recon- stituted plot together with compensation for loss of the difference in the area between the original and reconstituted plot. The High Court further observed that a provision for awarding compensation on the basis of market value under s. 67 of the Act is a sufficient specification of a principle of compensation within the meaning of Art. 31(2), but the Act was still not saved for two reasons (1) that there was no principle for compensating an owner of land to whom noreconstituted plot was allotted and (2) that payment provided by the Act in satisfaction of the claim to land statutorily expropriated based on the market value of the land at the date of the declaration of intention to make a scheme was not payment of compensation guaranteed by Art. 31(2). The High Court was of the view that compensation based on the market value may be sufficient specification of principle of compensation within Art. 31(2) only if it is a just equivalent of the land expropriated and payment computed on the market value at a date many years before the date on which the land was acquired is inconsistent with the constitutional guarantee under Art. 31(2)."

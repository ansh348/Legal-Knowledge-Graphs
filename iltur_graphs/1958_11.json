Sen appearing for the respondents has argued that even if the expression sale of goods in Entry 48 is construed in the sense which it has in the Sale of Goods Act, that might render the impugned provisions of the Act ultra vires only in respect of a building contract which is one and indivisible, that there might be contracts which might consist of two distinct agreements, one for the sale of materials and another, for work and labour, and that in such a case, it would be competent to the State to impose tax on the sale of materials even construing that word in its narrow sense, and that these are matters which must be left to be investigated by the appropriate authorities. That undoubtedly is the correct legal position as observed in The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley Co. (Madras) Ltd.1 , and accordingly, when a question arises as to whether a particular works contract could be charged to sales tax, it will be for the authorities under the Act to determine whether the agreement in question is, on its true construction, a combination of an agreement to sell and an agreement to work,"

But that, in our opinion, is not the correct interpretation of the section. The two sub-sections together form integral parts of a single enactment, the object of which is to grant exemption from taxation in respect of such goods and to such extent as may from time to time be determined by the State Government. Section 6 (1), therefore, cannot have an operation independent of s. 6 (2), and an exemption granted thereunder is conditional and subject to any modification that might be issued under s. 6 (2). In this view, the impugned notification is intra vires and not open to challenge."

That undoubtedly is the correct legal position as observed in The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley Co. (Madras) Ltd.1 , and accordingly, when a question arises as to whether a particular works contract could be charged to sales tax, it will be for the authorities under the Act to determine whether the agreement in question is, on its true construction, a combination of an agreement to sell and an agreement to work,"

But that, in our opinion, is not the correct interpretation of the section. The two sub-sections together form integral parts of a single enactment, the object of which is to grant exemption from taxation in respect of such goods and to such extent as may from time to time be determined by the State Government. Section 6 (1), therefore, cannot have an operation independent of s. 6 (2), and an exemption granted thereunder is conditional and subject to any modification that might be issued under s. 6 (2).

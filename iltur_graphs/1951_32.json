In arriving at this finding, the courts below have fully discussed the evidence and given cogent reasons in support of their conclusions. This Court is usually reluctant to reinvestigate matters which have been fully investigated by the courts below and on which there are concurrent findings. In the present case, the appellant has failed to show to us any exceptional circumstances to induce us to depart from the sound and well established practice, and in this view the findings of the court below must be accepted. It was however contended that in any event the plaintiffs suit is barred under article 142 of the Limitation Act inasmuch as it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove that he had been in possession of the disputed lands, especially those mentioned in schedule II of the plaint, within 12 years of the suit, but he had failed to do so. In our opinion, this plea must be negatived."

In the present case, the appellant has failed to show to us any exceptional circumstances to induce us to depart from the sound and well established practice, and in this view the findings of the court below must be accepted. It was however contended that in any event the plaintiffs suit is barred under article 142 of the Limitation Act inasmuch as it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove that he had been in possession of the disputed lands, especially those mentioned in schedule II of the plaint, within 12 years of the suit, but he had failed to do so.

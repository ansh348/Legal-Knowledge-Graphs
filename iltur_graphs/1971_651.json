The appellants prayer in their writ petition was for a direction to the State of Punjab and the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Respondents 1 and 2, to implement Clause 4 pf the directive of the Central Government issued on April 18, 1965. In effect their prayer was that their pay should be fixed at the stage which they would have attained in the time scale of higher posts had they been promoted to those posts on the date set out in Clause 3 of the directive Clause 3 stated that their seniority should be companynted from the date on which their juniors stated companytinuous officiation in the higher posts because of their promotive under provisional gradation lists. As already stated, the High Court had numberoccasion to companysider the question whether this prayer companyld be granted, as it held that the directive of the Central Government had numbercontrolling operation in respect of the integration of the services in question. We see numberreason to deny the appellants the benefit of Clause 4 of the directive."

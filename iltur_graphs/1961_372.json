It has to be borne in mind that political relations between India and Pakistan were in a fluid and disturbed state immediately after the 14th August, 1947, but the position improved to a companysiderable extent by the 18th October, 1949, which it may be numbericed was the date when the Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949, was made. Persons who had transferred assets between the 14th August, 1947, and the 18th October, 1949, may therefore reasonably have been companysidered by the legislature to form a class distinct in respect of the application of the law to their property from those who transferred assets after the 18th October, 1949."

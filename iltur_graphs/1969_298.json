Laws protected by Art. 19 6 are regarded as valid even though they impinge upon the fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 19 1 That is the effect of the scheme contained in Art. 19 I read with clauses 2 to 6 of the said Article. That being so it would be unreasonable to place upon the relevant clause an unduly wide and liberal construction. A law relating to -a State monopoly cannot, in the context, include all the provisions contained in the said law whether they have direct relation with the creation of the monopoly or not.

The Trial Court held that all the suit properties except a small portion did belong to Chandrappa and the plaintiffs would be entitled to 5/6th share of Chandrappas properties and the 6th defendant to the remaining 1/6th share, on the death of Chandrappas widow Ramamma. He however accepted the defence case that Nagayya had become entitled to the property on Chandrappas death as Chandrappas illatom son-in-law and accordingly dismissed the suit. On appeal, the High Court held that the custom by which an illatom son-in-law inherited property could not be extended to a case where the marriage took place not with the daughter of the owner of the property but with some other relation of his."

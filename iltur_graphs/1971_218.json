He does number act in any manner different from a numberofficial who obtains things on credit and then refuses to pay. In this case P. W. 13, Mukand Lal, partner of M s. Empire Stores, who appeared as a prosecution witness, stated that the firm allowed the respondent credit sales in his capacity as a known customer and all their customers got credit facilities. He further said that the firm allowed customers fairly long terms of credit. They usually avoided going to companyrt for the recovery of their dues, and they got payment from their customers of dues whose recovery had become barred by time. He also added that the firm still expected that the amounts standing against the respondent would be paid by him. It does number appear that there was any suggestion that the respondent obtained this credit only because he was an Income-tax Officer."

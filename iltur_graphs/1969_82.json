The idol is capable of holding property in the same way as a natural person. It has a juridical status with the power of suing and being sued. Its interests are attended to by the person who has the deity in his charge and who is in law its manager with all the powers which would, in such circumstances, on analogy, be given to the manager of the estate of an infant heir. The question, however, is whether the idol is capable of cultivating the land personally. The argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that under Explanation I in s. 2  12  of the Act a person who is subject to any physical or mental disability shall be deemed to cultivate the land personally if it is cultivated by her or his servants or by hired laborer"

It is urged that in Explanation  I  the idol would be in the same position as a minor and it can certainly cultivate the land personally within the meaning of s. 2 12 . It is difficult to accept the suggestion that the case of the appellant would fall within Explanation  I  in s. 2 12 .

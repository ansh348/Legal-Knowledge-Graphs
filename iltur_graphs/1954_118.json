The learned Judges of the High Court were of the opinion that as the execution and attestation took place at one sitting at the residence of P.W. 1, where the testator and the witnesses had assembled by appointment, they must all of them have been present until the matter was finished, and as the witnesses were number cross-examined on the question of attestation, it companyld properly be inferred that there was due attestation. It cannot be laid down as a matter of law that because the witnesses did number state in examination-in-chief that they signed the will in the presence of the testator, there was numberdue attestation. It will depend on the circumstances elicited in evidence whether the attesting witnesses signed in the presence of the testator. This is a pure question of fact depending on appreciation of evidence.

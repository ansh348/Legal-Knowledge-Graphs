It is possible that the Election Tribunal did not appreciate the true legal position and has in consequence failed to record the findings requisite for a decision on Rule 118, and that would be a good ground on which we could, if the justice of the case required it, set aside the order and direct the matter to be heard afresh and disposed of by another Tribunal in accordance with law. But we do not consider that this is a fit case for passing such an order. The evidence adduced by the first respondent is very largely, to the effect that the appellants men did election work in the morning or in the evening, that is , out of office hours."

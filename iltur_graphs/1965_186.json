The directors did not make any other determination with regard to quorum, and at all material times, a quorum of three was required for a directors meeting. The board meeting of May 25, 1946 was attended by three directors only, namely, M. C. Loya, D. R. Nayak and Narayandas. At this meeting, the directors resolved to allot 2000 shares to the nominees of Narayandas. Narayandas was clearly interested in the allotment of the shares. Section 91B(1) of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 provided that No director shall, as a director, vote on any contract or arrangement in which he is either directly or indirectly concerned or interested nor shall his presence count for the purpose of forming a quorum at the time of any such vote and if he does so vote, the vote shall not be counted. The Poona Bank, Ltd. was a public company, and s. 91B(1) applied to its directors. Narayandas, therefore, ought not to have voted at the meeting of May 25, 1946. If his vote is excluded, there was no quorum for the meeting. Mr. Purushottam Tricamdas, therefore, contended that the allotment of 2000 shares to the nominees of Narayandas at this meeting was invalid and no title passed to the allottees in respect of the shares, and in the circumstances, there was a total failure of the consideration paid for the shares, and as the consideration was paid out of the loans, the appellants are not liable to repay the same."

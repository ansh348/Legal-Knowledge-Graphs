A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 751 The learned counsel for the Government further contended that the charge against the plaintiff in the departmental proceedings was a charge of negligence and not a charge in connection with the commission of a criminal offence in connection with his official relations with public. The charge reads as under That you on 22-6-57 at 8.30 a.m. were sent for checking cycle thieves vide D. D. No. 9 dated 22-6-57 P. S. Faiz Bazar, but left your place of duty and alongwith F. C. Thakur Dayal No. 6105 went to Asaf Ali Road from where you took F. Cs. Lekh Raj No. 6512 and Bhagat Ram No. 1952. You accompanied by the three F. Cs. mentioned above went to the Harijan Basti in the area of Rouse Avenue in search of some Sattabaz. That you or any of your F. Cs. were not in Police Uniform. That you raided some Harijans who were sitting on the cots under a tree without giving your identity under the pretext of gambling. That altercation took place between your two Cs. Thakur Dayal No. 6105 and Bhagat Ram No. 1952 and the Harijans, where in these two Cs. and Mst. Batto mother of Mohan Lal were injured. That no independent witness or informer were produced by you before the investigation officer to show whether or not your raid was of bona fide nature. I, therefore, charge you for gross negligence of duty. But according to the final sentence in the summary of allegations this action amounted to gross negligence of duty and misconduct. It seems to us that it was a colourable attempt to avoid the effect of Police Rule 16.38 sub-rule 1 . It is a clear case of criminal offence and it was a mere device to call it gross negligence."

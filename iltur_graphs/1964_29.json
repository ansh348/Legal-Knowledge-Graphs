        "surface_text": "This view gets support from the judgment of this Court in Ramji Missar v. State of Bihar 1 . The facts of that case relevant to the present case were as follows The Assistant Sessions Judge, Arrah, companymitted one Basist under s. 307 and s. 326 of the Indian Penal Code. As the offences under the said sections were punishable with imprisonment for life, the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, were number applicable to Basist and, therefore, the Assistant Sessions Judge sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 6 years under s. 307 of the Indian Penal Code and for 4 years rigorous imprisonment under s. 326 of the said Code and ordered the sentences to run companycurrently. But the High Court on appeal found Basist guilty of an offence under s.324 of the Indian Penal Code. It was companytended that the High Court companyld number make an order under s.6 1  of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, on the ground that s. 11 of the Act did number companyfer such a power on the High Court. Dealing with this argument, this Court observed- It is however possible that the words in s. 11 1  pass an order under the Act are number to be companystrued so strictly and literally, but to be understood to mean to exercise the powers or jurisdiction companyferred by the Act. This wide interpretation might perhaps be justified by the scope and object of this section. Section 11 is to apply numberwithstanding anything in the Code or any other law to all companyrts empowered to sentence offenders to imprisonment. To read a beneficial provision of this universal type in a restricted sense, so as to companyfine the power of these companyrts to the exercise of the powers under ss. 3 and 4 alone would number, in our opinion, be in accord with sound principles of statutory interpretation. We are therefore inclined to hold that the Courts mentioned in s. II be they trial companyrts or exercising appellate or revisional jurisdiction are thereby empowered to exercise the jurisdiction companyferred on Courts number only under ss. 3 and 4 and the companysequential provisions but also under s.6. 1963 Supp. 2 S.C.R. 745, 755."

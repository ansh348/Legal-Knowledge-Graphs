It is true that in this case there was no occasion to consider the applicability of the provisions of O. 47 of the Code but that does not make any difference. If the Code of Civil Procedure applies to the proceedings before the Labour Appellate Tribunal, it is clear that the provisions of O. 47 would apply to these proceedings as much as s.151 of the Code or the provisions of O. 41.

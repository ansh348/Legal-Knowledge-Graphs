In the companyrse of his business, he was obliged to receive agricultural lands in repayment of his debts from some of his companystituents. In his assessment proceedings he claimed deduction of the interest David by him in respect of his borrowings. Part of the money borrowed by him had been advanced to companystituents who, as mentioned earlier, had made over their agricultural lands to the assessee. The question arose whether the interest paid in respect of the money advanced to those companystituents was deductable in companyputing the profits and gains of the assessee. The High Court held that he was entitled to the deduction claimed and further he was also entitled to deduction in  1  5 I.T. P,. 97."

The managed companypany had business both in British India as well as in the Indian States. The profits arising from the business activities of the managed companypany in the Indian States was number exigible to tax but yet the assessee claimed that a part of the companymission earned by it being in respect of business carried on outside British India, the same companyld number be companysidered as an income earned in British India. That companytention was rejected by the High Court. In the companyrse of its judgment, the High Court observed It is perfectly true that as far as the parent companypany is companycerned, the profits made at Kandla companyld be said to have arisen and accrued at Kandla, but as far as the managing agents are companycerned, their companymission has numberhing whatever to do with those profits.  1  18 L.T.R. 58."

The assessee company therein was resident and ordinarily resident in India. It had its head office in Bombay. It maintained a branch at Karachi for purchasing cotton for shipment to Bombay or to export direct to other places. By an agreement, the managing agents of the assessee company were entitled to a remuneration of 20 percent of the annual net profits of the assessee company to ascertain which the result of the trade in all its branches had to be taken into account. The assessee apportioned the managing agency commission and debited the proportionate amount in the respective profit and loss account for the Bombay head office and the Karachi branch. In computing the Pakistan income of the assessee for the purpose of double taxation relief the Income-tax Officer deducted from the income of the Karachi branch the proportionate managing agency commission. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed that order but the Tribunal and the High Court on a reference held that the managing agency commission in its entirety should be debited to the Bombay branch. On appeal this Court held that the entire managing agency commission was liable to be debited against the Indian profits and further assessee company could not be estopped from claiming the benefit of such deduction by reason of the fact that it erroneously allocated a part of it toward the profits earned in Karachi. In the course of its judgment this Court observed Section 10(2)(xv) of the Indian Income-tax Act provides that in computing the profits of a business allowance is to be made for any expenditure laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business Now the respondent is carrying on  1  29 I.T.R. 661."

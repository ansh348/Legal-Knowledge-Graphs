In that case the majority while upholding the validity of section 8 2  b  observed It has been argued on behalf of the appellants that the fixation of rate of tax is a legislative function and as the Parliament has. under section 8 2  b  of the Act, number fixed the rate of Central sales tax but has adopted the rate applicable to the sale or purchase of goods inside the appropriate State in case such rate exceeds 10 per cent, the parliament has abdicated its legislative function.

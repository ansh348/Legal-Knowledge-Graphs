The learned Judges have made the following significant observation in regard to Hazari It seems to us that Hazari had said this because the prosecution was producing Bega, and he must have been asked to say that Bega was also present. So far as the story of Hazari about -the incident itself is concerned, nothing has been brought out in his cross-examination to throw doubts on this part of his statement. They also pointed out, but attached noimportance, to other contradictions in the statements of Hazari made before the trial court and before the Police. If as observed by the learned Judges of the High Court, Hazari had mentioned the presence of Bega merely because the latter was to be produced as a prosecution witness and because he Hazari had been asked to mention it, then it would detract so materially from his reliability that it would be dangerous to accept his testimony as being of any great value which is still more diminished by the finding as to the innocence of Mt.

The learned Judges have made the following significant observation in regard to Hazari It seems to us that Hazari had said this because the prosecution was producing Bega, and he must have been asked to say that Bega was also present. So far as the story of Hazari about -the incident itself is concerned, nothing has been brought out in his cross-examination to throw doubts on this part of his statement. They also pointed out, but attached noimportance, to other contradictions in the statements of Hazari made before the trial court and before the Police. If as observed by the learned Judges of the High Court, Hazari had mentioned the presence of Bega merely because the latter was to be produced as a prosecution witness and because he Hazari had been asked to mention it, then it would detract so materially from his reliability that it would be dangerous to accept his testimony as being of any great value which is still more diminished by the finding as to the innocence of Mt.

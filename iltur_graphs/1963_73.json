It was further averred that the departmental enquiry instituted against the appellant had nothing to do with the order of reversion. The respondents relied on Explanation  4  to r. 3 of the All India Services  Discipline and Appeal  Rules, 1955, which says that the reversion to a lower post of a member of the service who is officiating in a higher post, after a trial in the higher post or for administrative reasons  such as the return of the permanent incumbent from leave or deputation, availability of a more suitable officer, and the like  does not amount to reduction in rank within the meaning of r. 3 which deals with penalties that may, for good and sufficient reasons, be im- posed on a member of the service."

This Court held that the expression sale of goods was, at the time when the Government of India Act, 1935 was enacted, a term of well recognised legal import in the general law relating to sale of goods and in the legislative practice relating to that topic and must be interpreted as having the same meaning as in the sale of Goods Act 1930 In the companyrse of the judgment, Venkatarama Aiyar, J,who ,spoke for the Court after examining the various decisions cited at the Bar, observed, as follows Thus, according to the law both of England and of India, in order to companystitute a sale it is necessary that there should be an agreement between the parties for the purpose of transferring title to goods which of companyrse pre-supposes capacity to companytract, that it must be supported by money companysideration and that as a result of the transaction property must actually pass in the goods."

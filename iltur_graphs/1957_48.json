If they were genuine transactions, by virtue of which money did pass to them on the basis of good security, showing these amounts to be genuine business investments, then it would be difficult to make out that there was any criminal breach of trust. Hence all evidence which would go to show that these transactions are bogus, is certainly admissible. That would be so numberwithstanding that such evidence may necessitate reference to and narration of the acts of the companyspirators beyond the period of companyspiracy but within reasonable limits. While it may be true that the manipulations by way of the four fresh transactions from May to December, 1949  apart from other features of these transactions of which evidence has been given  would be companyent evidence to show that the original transactions were bogus, the evidence relating to the further transactions to screen these transactions of the second half of 1949 by utilising the money of the Empire of India after obtaining the companytrol thereof, and by wrongfully utilising the Jupiters securities, would also be relevant to make out and emphasise the bogus character of the  1  I 874  1 1 Bom.

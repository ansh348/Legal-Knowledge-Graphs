We do not agree that there was no charge by the respondent against the workmen concerned. The first part of the notice of December 15, 1960 which was served on each individual workmen was certainly a charge by the respondent telling the workmen concerned that they were guilty of go-slow for the period between November 27 and December 15, 1960."

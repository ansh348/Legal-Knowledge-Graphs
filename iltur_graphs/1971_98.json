In support of this contention-, the learned counsel relied on the reasoning contained in paragraph 18 of the award. We have gone through the reasoning contained in the said paragraph and we do not find any finding recorded by the Tribunal that the State has not acted bona fide, when it passed an order terminating the services of the employees. On the other hand, what the Tribunal has held in the said paragraph is that the termination of the services of the employees is invalid and illegal as it is not warranted by Paragraph 11 of the Code and hence the order of termination is invalid in law and inoperative. There is absolutely no basis for the contention that these findings are to the effect that the action of the State is not bona fide. Thus the findings recorded by the Tribunal are findings on the basis of the interpretation placed by it on Paragraph 11 that the State has no power to terminate simpliciter the services of a work-charged establishment.

In support of this contention-, the learned counsel relied on the reasoning contained in paragraph 18 of the award. We have gone through the reasoning contained in the said paragraph and we do not find any finding recorded by the Tribunal that the State has not acted bona fide, when it passed an order terminating the services of the employees. On the other hand, what the Tribunal has held in the said paragraph is that the termination of the services of the employees is invalid and illegal as it is not warranted by Paragraph 11 of the Code and hence the order of termination is invalid in law and inoperative. There is absolutely no basis for the contention that these findings are to the effect that the action of the State is not bona fide. Thus the findings recorded by the Tribunal are findings on the basis of the interpretation placed by it on Paragraph 11 that the State has no power to terminate simpliciter the services of a work-charged establishment. Therefore, this contention of Mr, Ramamurthy has to be rejected."

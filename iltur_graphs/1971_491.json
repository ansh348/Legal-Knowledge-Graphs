State of Madras 1  one of the, questions which this Court had to companysider in that case was whether the Madras Legislature was companypetent to enact the provisions of sub-section  1  of s. 2 of the Madras General Sales Tax  Special Provisions  Act, 1963. Hides and skins had been declared under Act LII of 1952 to be essential for the life of the companymunity. Art. 286 3  of the Constitution as it stood before its amendment by the Constitution VI Amendment Act of 1956, on September 11, 1958 provided that notlaw made by the Legislature of a State imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by Parliament by law to be essential for he life of the companymunity shall have effect unless it has been reserved for the companysideration of the President and has received his assent. By August 28, 1963, when the Act was enacted by the Madras Legislature, Art. 286 3  had been amended and Act LII of 1952 had also been repealed. Consequently there was noConstitutional requirement for the Act being reserved for the assent of the President before it could be enforced. But it was contended for the petitioner there that the Act was really enacted for a period, when if passed, it had to receive the Presidents assent for its enforcement and that therefore the State Legislature could not even in 1963 enact this provision affecting the taxation law in respect of the sale or purchase of goods which were goods  1  1964 8 S.C.R. 217 at 231."

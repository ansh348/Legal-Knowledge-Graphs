The Income-tax Officer, even when he accepts the assessee's method of accounting, is not bound by the figure of profits shown in the accounts. If and when an appeal is taken by the assessee to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the latter can re-examine the books of account to test the correctness of the assessment made. It is not disputed before us that accounts must be distinguished from the method of accounting. Section 13 and its proviso are concerned with the method of accounting. In the context of the statement of the case, however, the first question really means this: is it open to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, on an appeal preferred by the assessee, to reject for the first time the method of accounting, purporting to act under the proviso to s. 13 of the Act, on the ground that the income, profits and gains cannot be properly deduced therefrom, when the Income-tax Officer although he has not expressly said so must be taken to have accepted the self-same method of accounting ?"

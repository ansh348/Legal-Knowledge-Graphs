The learned advocate, however, referred us to prayer in para 9 of the written statement in which a plea was taken that the suit is not maintainable and that the plaintiff ought to have submitted its claim before the Debts Settlement Board. This plea is general in character and does-not indicate that the suit is liable to be dismissed as the mortgage is unsupported by consideration. There was also neither an issue in the trial court nor has any ground been taken in the Memo of Appeal though as many as 75 grounds were urged against the judgment of the trial court. We cannot, therefore, permit the appellant to raise any contention based on the mortgage being unenforceable for want of consideration for the first time in this Court."

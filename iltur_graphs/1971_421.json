Regarding the first question, the learned companynsel companytends that as the amounts in question were never received by the appellant but were relinquished, there arose numbertax liability for those amounts. As regards the second question, Mr. Maheshwari submits that the relinquishment of the amounts should be companystrued as permissible expenditure under section 10 2   xv  of the Act. There is, in our opinion, numbersubstance in any of the above companytentions. So far as the first question is companycerned, we find that according to clause 2 e  of the Managing Agency Agreement reproduced above, the companymission for the two years in question became due to the appellant on the 31st day of December, 1954 and 31st day of December, 1955. The appellant also became entitled to receive fixed office allowance of Rs. 12,000/- for each of the two years. It, therefore, can be said that the income of Rs. 50,719/- had accrued to the appellant on 31st December, 1954 and of Rs. 13,973/- on 31st December, 1955. The fact that the pay- ment of the managing agency companymission was deferred till after the accounts had been passed in the meetings of. the managed companypany did number affect the accrual of the income of those amounts on December 31, 1954 and December 31, 1955 respectively."

As regards the second question, Mr. Maheshwari submits that the relinquishment of the amounts should be companystrued as permissible expenditure under section 10 2   xv  of the Act. There is, in our opinion, numbersubstance in any of the above companytentions. So far as the first question is companycerned, we find that according to clause 2 e  of the Managing Agency Agreement reproduced above, the companymission for the two years in question became due to the appellant on the 31st day of December, 1954 and 31st day of December, 1955. The appellant also became entitled to receive fixed office allowance of Rs. 12,000/- for each of the two years. It, therefore, can be said that the income of Rs. 50,719/- had accrued to the appellant on 31st December, 1954 and of Rs. 13,973/- on 31st December, 1955. The fact that the pay- ment of the managing agency companymission was deferred till after the accounts had been passed in the meetings of. the managed companypany did number affect the accrual of the income of those amounts on December 31, 1954 and December 31, 1955 respectively."

As regards the second question, Mr. Maheshwari submits that the relinquishment of the amounts should be companystrued as permissible expenditure under section 10 2   xv  of the Act. There is, in our opinion, numbersubstance in any of the above companytentions. So far as the first question is companycerned, we find that according to clause 2 e  of the Managing Agency Agreement reproduced above, the companymission for the two years in question became due to the appellant on the 31st day of December, 1954 and 31st day of December, 1955. The appellant also became entitled to receive fixed office allowance of Rs. 12,000/- for each of the two years. It, therefore, can be said that the income of Rs. 50,719/- had accrued to the appellant on 31st December, 1954 and of Rs. 13,973/- on 31st December, 1955. The fact that the pay- ment of the managing agency companymission was deferred till after the accounts had been passed in the meetings of. the managed companypany did number affect the accrual of the income of those amounts on December 31, 1954 and December 31, 1955 respectively."

        "surface_text": "Mr. Maheshwari has assailed the findings of the High Court. Regarding the first question, the learned companynsel companytends that as the amounts in question were never received by the appellant but were relinquished, there arose numbertax liability for those amounts. As regards the second question, Mr. Maheshwari submits that the relinquishment of the amounts should be companystrued as permissible expenditure under section 10 2   xv  of the Act. There is, in our opinion, numbersubstance in any of the above companytentions. So far as the first question is companycerned, we find that according to clause 2 e  of the Managing Agency Agreement reproduced above, the companymission for the two years in question became due to the appellant on the 31st day of December, 1954 and 31st day of December, 1955. The appellant also became entitled to receive fixed office allowance of Rs. 12,000/- for each of the two years. It, therefore, can be said that the income of Rs. 50,719/- had accrued to the appellant on 31st December, 1954 and of Rs. 13,973/- on 31st December, 1955. The fact that the pay- ment of the managing agency companymission was deferred till after the accounts had been passed in the meetings of. the managed companypany did number affect the accrual of the income of those amounts on December 31, 1954 and December 31, 1955 respectively."

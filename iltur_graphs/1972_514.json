The fact that a rule by way of an instruction has been introduced in the Red Book limiting the consideration of applications only to the immediately prior period cannot have any value in so far as the rights of parties come in for examination. The rights of the established importer to the licence for the back periods cannot be denied if his application had been kept pending for reasons other than laches on the part of the applicant. An application for import licence for a particular period must be considered only in the light of the policy relevant to that period and cannot be refused on the basis of a later policy which might have changed the position with regard to the licences for the import of the item applied for.

In other words, the points of law raised by the petition were dismissed on the merits.

In Writ Petition No. 8 of 1960 the position is substantially different. The previous petition for a writ filed by the petitioner No. 68 of 1952 in the Allahabad High Court was withdrawn by his learned companynsel and the High Court therefore dismissed the said petition with the express observation that the merits had number been companysidered by the High Court in dismissing it and so numberorder is to companyts was passed.

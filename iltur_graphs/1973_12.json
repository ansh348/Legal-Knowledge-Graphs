The phrase used in article 20 (3) is to be a witness and not to appear as a witness-. It follows that the protection afforded to an accused in so far as it is related to the phrase to be a witness is not merely in respect of testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from him.

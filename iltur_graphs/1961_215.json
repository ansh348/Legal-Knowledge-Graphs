Raghunath Gopal Patwardhan 1 , this Court after setting out the three possible views on the question whether a dispute by an individual workman may be regarded as an industrial dispute within the meaning of s. 2 k  of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 observed The preponderance of judicial opinion is clearly in favour of the last of the three views ,stated above  i. e. a dispute between an employer and a single employee cannot per se be an industrial dispute, but it may become one if it is taken up by the Union or a number of workmen and there is companysiderable reason behind it. Notwithstanding that the language of s. 2 k  is wide enough to companyer a dispute between an employer and a single employee, the scheme of the Industrial Disputes Act does appear to companytemplate that the machinery provided therein should be set in motion, to settle only disputes which involve the rights of workmen as a class and that a dispute touching the individual right, of a workman was number intended to be the subject of an adjudication under the Act, when the same had number been taken  1 1956 S.

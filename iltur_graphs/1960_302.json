In that case a firm companysisting of three partners carried on business under the name of P. Nagoji Rao Son, with one of them Gannu Rao as managing-partner. The chargeable accounting periods companycerned were the years from April 1, 1944 to March 31, 1946. There were quarrels among the partners which led to the filing of a suit on February 26, 1947, for dissolution and accounts by two of the partners against the managing-partner. The suit was decreed on November 14, 1947, declaring the firm dissolved as and from the institution of the suit-February 26, 1947. The assessment of the business to Excess Profits Tax was companypleted by numberices issued subsequent to that date to Gannu Rao as managing-partner and the order of assessment was passed on December 31, 1949, and a numberice of demand under s. 29 of the Income Tax Act was served on him. No demand numberices were served on the other two partners, but proceedings for the recovery of the tax were taken against them on the strength of the numberices served on Gannu Rao. These two partners moved the High Court  1   1954  26 I.T. 99."

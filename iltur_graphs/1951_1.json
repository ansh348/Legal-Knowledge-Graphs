Put shortly, the question that falls to be decided is Is it within the companypetence of the companyrt to examine the grounds companymunicated to a person detained under the Act, with a view to see if they are sufficient in its opinion to enable him to make a representation to the detaining authority against the order, and if they are number, to direct his release ? It is number settled by the decision of the majority in Gopalans case 1  that article 21 is applicable to preven- tive detention except in so far as the provisions of article 22  4  to  7  either expressly or by necessary implication exclude its application, with the result that a person cannot be deprived of his personal liberty, even for preven- tive purposes, except according to procedure established by law."

J.--While I concur in the order pro- posed by my Lord that this appeal should be allowed, I regret I find myself unable to agree with him on the true meaning and effect of article 22, clause  5 , which is reproduced in section 7 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950,  hereinafter referred to as the Act . Put shortly, the question that falls to be decided is Is it within the companypetence of the companyrt to examine the grounds companymunicated to a person detained under the Act, with a view to see if they are sufficient in its opinion to enable him to make a representation to the detaining authority against the order, and if they are number, to direct his release ? It is number settled by the decision of the majority in Gopalans case 1  that article 21 is applicable to preven- tive detention except in so far as the provisions of article 22  4  to  7  either expressly or by necessary implication exclude its application, with the result that a person cannot be deprived of his personal liberty, even for preven- tive purposes, except according to procedure established by law."

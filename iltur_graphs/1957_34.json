He was also placed under suspension from that date. On July 29, 1950, the appellant sent his explanation denying the allegations contained in the notice dated July 6, 1950. The matter was then referred to the Committee of Advisers, who held an enquiry on September 8,1950, and after hearing the appellant found that the charges against him mentioned in the notice were true. Acting on this report, the General Manager terminated the services of the appellant on April 3, 1951, giving him one months salary instead of notice."

It was a case where a hirer of a motor-car under a hire-purchase agreement under which the necessary payments of installment etc. bad number been made and so his title had number matured i.e. where the title remained in the owner  transferred the vehicle or such rights as he possessed in it, to others and the ultimate transfers paid the balance of the purchase price to the owner and thus acquired title to the motor-car. The question before the Court related to the effect of this companypletion in the title of the ultimate transferee on the legal position of the intermediate parties. Pearson J. dealing with this matter expressed himself in these terms The various purported sales all took place at times when Bowmaker, Ltd. were still the owners of the car, so that all the purported sellers in this rather long chain had numbertitle to it at the times when the purported sales were made. But on or about  1  1954 2 AU E. R. 694 July 25, 1952 Miss Rudolph acquired a good title from Bowmaker, Ltd., or, at any rate, made payment to Bowmaker, Ltd. which ext- inguished their title and induced them to relinquish any claim which they had to the car. I think that the right view is that Miss Rudolph acquired the title as between her and Bowmaker, Ltd. but I further hold on authority that the title so acquired went to feed the previously defective titles of the subsequent buyers and ensured to their benefit"

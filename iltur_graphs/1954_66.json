Chatterjee for the appellant is that in reaching this conclusion the Tribunal had taken into consideration matters which are wholly extraneous to an enquiry under section 100 2 c , such as the mistake of the polling officer in issuing wrong ballot papers and its possible effect on the result of the voting, and that accordingly the decision was liable to be quashed by certiorari both on the ground of error of jurisdiction and error in the construction of section 100 2 c apparent on the face of the record. The first respondent, on the other hand, contended that the decision of the Tribunal that the 301 ballot papers found in his box should have been rejected under Rule 47 1 c was erroneous, because that rule was only directory and not mandatory and because the Election Commission had validated them, and that its decision was final. He also contended that even if the ballot papers in question were liable to be rejected under Rule 47 1 c , for the purpose of deciding under section 100 2 c whether the result of the election had been materially affected the Tribunal had to ascertain the true intention of the voters and the mistake of the polling officer under Rule 23 and its effect on the result of the election were matters which were within the scope of the enquiry under that section. The correctness of these contentions falls not to be determined. On the question whether Rule 47 1 c is mandatory, the argument of Mr. Pathak is that notwithstanding that the rule provides that the Returning Officer shall reject the ballot papers, its real meaning is that he has the power to reject them, and that on that construction, his discretion in the matter of accepting them is not liable to be questioned."

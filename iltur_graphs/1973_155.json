The words takes or entices any minor out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor in s. 361, are. significant. The use of the word keeping in the context connotes the idea of charge, protection, maintenance and control further the guardians charge and control appears to be compatible with the independence of action and movement in the minor, the guardians protection and control of the minor being available, whenever necessity arises. On plain reading of this section the consent of the minor who is taken or enticed is wholly immaterial it is only the guardians consent which takes the case out of its purview. Nor is it necessary that the taking or enticing must be shown to have been by means of force or fraud.

State of Madras 1 , on which Shri Dhebar placed principal reliance, Shri Dhebar relied on the following passage at page 245 of the report - It will thus be, seen that taking or enticing away a minor out of the keeping of a lawful guardian is an essential ingredient of the offence of kidnapping. Here, we are not concerned with enticement but what, we have to find out is whether the part played by the appellant amounts to taking, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of Savitri, We have no doubt that though Savitri had been left by S. Natarajan at the house of- his relative K. Natarajan, she still continued to be in the lawful keeping of the former but then the question remains as to what is it which the appellant did that constitutes in law taking. There is not a word in the deposition of Savitri from which an inference could be drawn that she left the house of K. Natarajan at the instance or even a suggestion of the appellant. In fact she candidly admits that on the morning of October 1st, she herself telephoned to the appellant to meet her in his car at a certain place, went up to that place and finding him waiting in the car got into that car of her own accord."

It would, however, be sufficient if the, prosecution establishes that though immediately prior to the minor leaving the fathers protection no active part was played by the accused, he had at some earlier stage solicited or persuaded the minor to do so. In our opinion if evidence to establish one of those things is lacking it would not be legitimate to infer that the accused is guilty of taking the minor out of the keeping of the lawful guardian merely because after she has actually left her guardians house or a house where her guardian had kept her, joined the accused and the accused helped her in her design not to return to her guardians house by taking her along with him from place to place."

The decision in Lakshan Chunder Dey v. Sm. Nikunjamani Dassi 1 is relied on, in support of this position. But it is contended for the first respondent that even if Suit No. 158 of 1935 is considered as pending when the transfer in favour of the appellant was made, that would not affect the result as no application had been made by her to be brought on record in the original court during the pendency of the suit. Nor could the application made to the appellate Court be sustained under 0. 22, r. 10, as the transfer in favour of the appellant was made prior to the filing of that appeal and not during its pendency.

Raw Cotton Co., Ltd. 1 , wherein it was hold that a transferee of a debt on which a suit was pending was entitled to execute the decree which was subsequently passed therein, under s. 146 of the Civil Procedure Code as a person claiming under the decree-holder, even though an application for execution by him would not lie under 0. 21, r. 16, and it was further observed that the words save as otherwise provided only barred proceedings, which would be obnoxious to some provision of the Code. It would follow from the above authorities that whoever is entitled to be but has not been brought on record under 0. 22, r. 10 in a pending suit or proceeding would be entitled to prefer an appeal against the decree or order passed therein if his assignor could have filed such an appeal, there being no prohibition against it in the Code, and that accordingly the appellant as an assignee of the second respondent of the mortgaged properties would have been entitled to prefer an appeal against the judgment of P. B. Mukharji J. It is next contended that s. 146 authorises only the initiation of any proceeding, and that though it would have been competent to the appellant to have preferred an appeal against the judoment of P. B. Mukharji J. she not having done so was not entitled to be brought on record as an appellant to continue the appeal preferred by the second respondent."

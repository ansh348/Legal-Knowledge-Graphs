The Magistrate took the view that there wag numberdirect evidence to show that the accused had companymitted theft or had obtained property fraudulently but there were in his opinion circumstances which led to the reasonable belief that the gold in question was either stolen or was fraudulently obtained. The Sessions Judge held that although the possession of the gold was highly suspicious, nevertheless it did number companystitute sufficient ground for a reasonable belief that the property was either stolen or was fraudulently obtained. He accordingly set aside the companyviction and sentence and ordered the gold to be restored to the appellant. The High Court in appeal by the State did number accept the prosecution story that the gold was brought into India by the appellant in his motor-car, but held agreeing with the Magistrate that from the circumstances there was reason to believe that he was in possession of gold which was either stolen property or property fraudulently obtained. The High Court did number accept the explanation of the appellant that his father had brought the gold to Sarsa from time to time when he visited his native place. As regards the order of companyfiscation under section 517, the High Court held that it was number necessary that the property companyfiscated must be the property in relation to which an offence appears to have been companymitted but it was enough if ,the property is produced before the companyrt. In this view the acquittal was set aside and the order of the Magistrate was restored. Mr. Chatterjee on behalf of the appellant stated at the outset that he was number prepared to companycede that the appellants companyviction was right but he proceeded on the assumption that even if it was so, section 517 had numberapplication to the case and the companyrt had numberjurisdiction to pass the order of companyfiscation of the gold. He also urged that in any, view of the matter the order of companyfiscation was number a proper order in the circumstances of this case. Section 517 1  reads thus- When an inquiry or a trial in any criminal companyrt is companycluded, the companyrt may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal  by destruction, companyfiscation, or delivery to any person claiming to be entitled to possession thereof or otherwise  of any property or document produced before it or in its custody or regarding which any offence appears to. have been companymitted, or which has been used for the companymission of any offence."

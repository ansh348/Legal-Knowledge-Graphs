Even if a proceeding for contempt is initiated against the alleged contemner but the alleged contemner is found not guilty and is exonerated, there is no right of appeal, contended the learned Additional Solicitor General, and neither the Advocate General nor the person who has, with the consent in writing of the Advocate General, moved the High Court, can appeal as of right. The appellant, who appeared in person, combated this contention by relying on the words any order or decision in the exercise of its jurisdiction to punish for contempt and urged that even if a decision was taken by the High Court not to take action on the motion made by the Advocate General or any other person with the consent in writing of the Advocate General, it would still be a decision in the exercise of its jurisdiction to punish for contempt and would, therefore, be appealable on the plain terms of section 19, sub-section 1."

Chinubhai Manibhai, Seth 1  that an order made by the High Court refusing to committal a man for breach of an undertaking given to the Court is number a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent as it does number affect the merits of any question between the parties to the suit. Beaumont, C.J., pointed out the undertaking is given to the Court if it is broken, and that fact is brought to the Courts numberice, the Court may take such action as it thinks fit. If it comes to the conclusion that the order has been deliberately broken, it will probably commit the defaulter to jail, but the Court is free to adopt such course as it thinks fit. Rangnekar, J., also spoke in the same strain when he said Proceedings for contempt are matters entirely between the Court and the person alleged to have been guilty of contempt. No party has any statutory right to say that he is entitled as a matter of course to an order for committal because his opponent is guilty of contempt. All that he can do is to come to the Court and complain that the authority of the Court has been flouted, and if the Court thinks that it was so, then the Court in its discretion takes action to vindicate its authority. It is, therefore, difficult to see how an application for contempt raises any question between the parties, so that any order made I.L.R. 60 Bom. 894. on such an application by which the Court in its discretion refuses to take any action against the party alleged to be in the wrong can be said to raise any question between the parties."

We therefore agree with the High Court that this history affords a clue to the interpretation of s. 44-B 1 and suggests that though the words used in s. 44-B are open to a wide interpretation, the intention was to bring within its purview only those inams which were granted directly to the temple and also those inams which were granted for the performance of a charity or service connected with a math or temple, i.e., service inams or such inams the whole income of which was for charity and not those inams which were personal inams though burdened with some service to a temple or math."

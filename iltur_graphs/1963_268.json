In other words, in dealing with an industrial dispute in respect of which a failure report has been submitted under s. 12 4  the appropriate Government ultimately exercises its power under s 10 1 , subject to this that s. 12 5  imposes an obligation on it to record reasons for not making the reference when the dispute has gone through conciliation and a failure report has been made under s. 12 4 . This question has been considered by this Court in the case of the State of Bombay v. K. P. Krishnan Others  1 . The decision in that case clearly shows that when the appropriate Government considers the question as to whether any industrial dispute should be referred for adjudication- or not, it may consider, prima facie, the merits of the dispute and take into account other relevant considerations which would help it to decide whether making a reference would be expedient or not."

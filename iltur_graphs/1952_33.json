There can be numberdoubt that the provision of section 27  1  of the Bombay Act was made in the interest of the general public and to protect them against dangerous and bad characters whose presence in a particular locality may jeopardize the peace and safety of the citizens. The question, therefore, is whether the restrictions that this law imposes upon the rights of free movement of a citizen, companye within the purview of clause  5  of article 19 of the Constitution or in other words whether the restrictions are reasonable ? It is perfectly true that the determination of the question as to whether the restric- tions imposed by a legislative enactment upon the fundamen- tal rights of a citizen enunciated in article 19  1  d  of the Constitution are reasonable or number within the meaning of clause  5  of the article would depend as much upon the procedural part of the law as upon its substantive part and the companyrt has got to look in each case to the circumstances under which and the manner in which the restrictions have been imposed.

He is permitted to appear through an Advocate, or an Attorney and can file a written statement and examine witnesses for the purpose of clearing his character. The only point which Mr. Umrigar attempts to make in regard to the reasonableness of this procedure is that the suspected person is number allowed to cross-examine the witnesses who deposed against him and on whose evidence the proceedings were started. In our opinion this by itself would number make the procedure unreasonable having regard to the avowed intention of the legislature in making the enact- ment. The law is certainly an extraordinary one and has been made only to meet those exceptional cases where numberwitnesses for fear of violence to their person or property are willing to depose publicly against certain bad charac- ters whose presence in certain areas companystitutes a menace to the safety of the public residing therein. This object would be wholly defeated if a right to companyfront or cross- examine these witnesses was given to the suspect."

As has been stated already, on the 30th July, 1951, the petitioner himself by a letter written to the Commis- sioner of Police sought his permission to stay at Kalyan which is within the State of Bombay. His request was acced- ed to and the Police actually took him to Kalyan on the evening of the 30th. We think that, in these circumstances, the order made on the 23rd July, 1951, might be companystrued to be an order of externment from Greater Bombay and though there was a mistake regarding the place where the externee was to remove himself to, the mistake was rectified by the petitioner choosing Kalyan as the place of residence and that choice being accepted and given effect to by the Police Department.

There can be numberdoubt that the provision of section 27  1  of the Bombay Act was made in the interest of the general public and to protect them against dangerous and bad characters whose presence in a particular locality may jeopardize the peace and safety of the citizens. The question, therefore, is whether the restrictions that this law imposes upon the rights of free movement of a citizen, companye within the purview of clause  5  of article 19 of the Constitution or in other words whether the restrictions are reasonable ? It is perfectly true that the determination of the question as to whether the restric- tions imposed by a legislative enactment upon the fundamen- tal rights of a citizen enunciated in article 19  1  d  of the Constitution are reasonable or number within the meaning of clause  5  of the article would depend as much upon the procedural part of the law as upon its substantive part and the companyrt has got to look in each case to the circumstances under which and the manner in which the restrictions have been imposed. The maximum dura- tion of the externment order made under section 27  1  of the Bombay Act is a period of two years and the Commissioner of Police can always permit the externee to enter the pro- hibited area even before the expiration of that period."

He is permitted to appear through an Advocate, or an Attorney and can file a written statement and examine witnesses for the purpose of clearing his character. The only point which Mr. Umrigar attempts to make in regard to the reasonableness of this procedure is that the suspected person is number allowed to cross-examine the witnesses who deposed against him and on whose evidence the proceedings were started. In our opinion this by itself would number make the procedure unreasonable having regard to the avowed intention of the legislature in making the enact- ment. The law is certainly an extraordinary one and has been made only to meet those exceptional cases where numberwitnesses for fear of violence to their person or property are willing to depose publicly against certain bad charac- ters whose presence in certain areas companystitutes a menace to the safety of the public residing therein. This object would be wholly defeated if a right to companyfront or cross- examine these witnesses was given to the suspect."

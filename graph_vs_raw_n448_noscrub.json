The High Court rightly set aside the Tribunal's holding of prospective effect, and the Supreme Court is likely to uphold this by dismissing the appeal."

The compromise decree of 1946 creates a personal liability for the monthly allowance secured by a charge on specific properties, but since those properties are trust assets and the liability is personal (not a trust debt), execution against them is impermissible.

Given the 10-year possession of promotions, law in flux pre-Jagannadha Rao (2001), non-impleadment of necessary parties, and cascading effects on juniors, equity favors saving the promotions without reversion. Similar service jurisprudence, e.g., Kailash Chand Sharma, supports protecting long-held positions from invalid rules."

Courts prefer interpretations respecting specific clauses and adoption conditions over forcing a general application of paragraph 5 to avoid intestacy when textual limits exist. The omission of Injigudi in paragraph 13 does not override this for Kothangudi, and precedents on Hindu will construction support conditional dispositions."

      "graph_reasoning": "The Family Court and High Court's findings that the appellant was not married to Lakshmi violate natural justice (audi alteram partem), as Lakshmi was not made a party or given notice, rendering those findings null and void. Without validly disproving the subsisting first marriage (supported by appellant's evidence like ration card, photos, and son's documents), the respondent's claimed second marriage is void, disqualifying her from maintenance under Section 125 CrPC. The significant delay in the respondent's petition further weakens her claim, making the appeal likely to be accepted by setting aside the lower court orders.",

      "struct_reasoning": "The lower courts violated principles of natural justice by adjudicating the validity of the appellant's alleged marriage to Lakshmi without issuing notice to or hearing her as a necessary party, rendering their findings unsustainable. The appellant produced substantial documentary evidence (ration card, voter ID, son's transfer certificate, hospital records, wedding photos) supporting his 1980 marriage to Lakshmi, which would render any subsequent 1986 marriage to the respondent void under Hindu law prohibiting bigamy. The 12-year delay in the respondent's Section 125 Cr.P.C. petition further weakens her claim, making it likely the Supreme Court will set aside the lower courts' decisions."

      "graph_reasoning": "The Supreme Court is likely to invoke the doctrine of prospective overruling under Article 142, as it has done in similar Article 371-D cases like V. Jagannadha Rao and Govt. of A.P. v. B. Satyanarayana Rao, to protect long-held promotions and avoid harsh reversion, given the law's prior uncertainty. Lower courts like the Tribunal and High Court cannot invoke this doctrine, making the High Court's setting aside of prospective application subject to Supreme Court modification. The Presidential Order prevails, invalidating the rules, but relief will be moulded prospectively for complete justice.",

      "struct_reasoning": "The Supreme Court has the exclusive authority to invoke the doctrine of prospective overruling, as affirmed in precedents like Golak Nath, and can exercise it here under Article 142 to prevent hardship from reverting employees who held promotions for nearly a decade under rules valid at the time amid legal flux until Jagannadha Rao (2001). The appellants' non-impleadment in prior proceedings strengthens their case for protection, and SC has frequently applied prospective relief in service disputes to uphold equity. The High Court's reversal of the Tribunal's prospective application is likely to be set aside in favor of saving past promotions."

      "graph_reasoning": "The 10% deposit clause is manifestly arbitrary under Article 14, acting as a disproportionate clog on arbitration access with no rational nexus to curbing frivolous claims, leading to unjust forfeiture even on partial success, as per Central Inland Water Transport and doctrine of proportionality. State instrumentalities must adhere to fairness in contracts, and judicial review applies to ex facie arbitrary tender terms despite limited scrutiny under Tata Cellular. Respondents' equality plea fails as it practically burdens weaker claimants, aligning with striking down adhesion contracts.",

      "struct_reasoning": "The clause applies equally to both parties, ensuring no discrimination under Article 14, and courts refrain from interfering in commercial tender terms unless clearly arbitrary, as per Tata Cellular and Directorate of Education. The Brojo Nath Ganguly principle on unconscionable clauses is inapplicable to arm's-length commercial contracts between a private company and state instrumentality. The 10% deposit serves as a reasonable deterrent to frivolous claims without clogging arbitration, aligning with precedents upholding such security mechanisms."

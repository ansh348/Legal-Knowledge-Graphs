The Supreme Court has exclusive authority for prospective overruling, unlike the High Court or Tribunal, and frequently invokes it under Article 142 in service matters to prevent hardship from reversion.

B.S. Joshi and similar precedents support quashing FIRs in such cases under Section 482 CrPC, as the inherent power is not circumscribed by Section 320(9) for private wrongs without public interest. The High Court's refusal to quash likely misapplied the law, warranting the Supreme Court to accept the appeal and set aside the order.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The appellant relies on B.S. Joshi, which permitted quashing of non-compoundable offenses under Section 482 CrPC based on settlement to prevent abuse of process. The State argues for reconsideration citing other precedents, but the court explicitly states it is not inclined to accept this contention, at least in the facts of this case, indicating adherence to B.S. Joshi. This strongly suggests the appeal to quash the FIR will be accepted."

      "graph_reasoning": "The affidavit and verification suffer from material defects, including failure to disclose sources of information for paragraphs based on 'information' (paras 3,5-8) and improper affirmation/certification, violating Section 83(1)(c), Rule 94A, Form 25, and Order VI Rule 15 CPC. Precedents like H.D. Revanna v. G. Puttaswamy Gowda mandate strict compliance for election petitions alleging corrupt practices, rendering such defects fatal and non-curable, leading to dismissal under Section 86 RP Act. The petitioner had opportunity to cure defects but did not, justifying the High Court's dismissal and rejection of the appeal.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The High Court dismissed the election petition on valid preliminary grounds of non-compliance with Section 83(1)(c) and Section 85 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, requiring a properly affirmed affidavit in Form 25 disclosing sources of information, and Rule 94A of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. Despite objections and opportunity to cure defects, the appellant took no steps, rendering the petition defective ab initio. Supreme Court precedents strictly enforce these procedural mandates in election petitions, treating such defects as fatal rather than curable irregularities."

      "graph_reasoning": "The evidence of the building being 60 years old with cracks supports the landlord's bona fide need for demolition and reconstruction under Section 10(2)(vi), with permissions obtained. Section 25 of the Pondicherry Act empowers the High Court to examine the propriety of the appellate authority's findings, allowing reversal if perverse or against evidence, contrary to the petitioner's jurisdictional argument. Cited precedents on limited revisional scope are outweighed by the material facts favoring eviction.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The tenant-appellant's key argument is that under Section 25 of the Pondicherry Act, the High Court's revisional jurisdiction does not permit reversal of factual findings recorded by the First Appellate Court, supported by the Supreme Court precedent in M. Punnoose v. K.M. Munneruddin (2003) 10 SCC 610, which limits revisional powers to jurisdictional errors or perversity rather than re-appreciation of evidence. Given that the Trial Court and High Court favored eviction while the Appellate Authority (final fact-finder) did not, the Supreme Court is likely to hold that the High Court exceeded its revisional scope. This procedural infirmity strongly favors accepting the appeal and restoring the Appellate Authority's order."

      "graph_reasoning": "The Supreme Court's precedent in V. Jagannadha Rao clearly holds that Special Rules under Article 309 permitting transfer to higher categories violate the Presidential Order under Article 371-D, supporting the rules' invalidity and the High Court's correction of the Tribunal's prospective application. However, given the respondents' arguments on long-standing promotions, potential harshness of reversion, law in flux pre-VJR, and petitioners' procedural challenge lacking impleadment, the Court is likely to accept the appeal and invoke prospective overruling or Article 142 to modify the order and protect past appointments without unsettling settled rights.",
      "raw_pred": 0,
      "raw_conf": 0.85,
      "raw_reasoning": "The 2001 Supreme Court judgment in V. Jagannadha Rao declared the special rules violative of the Presidential Order under Article 371-D without indicating prospective application, and such declarations of invalidity typically operate retrospectively. The State Administrative Tribunal's holding of prospectivity was an unwarranted addition, and the High Court's order setting it aside correctly enforces the retrospective effect to uphold the Presidential Order's aim of equitable regional opportunities. The appeals challenging the High Court order lack merit on legal principles."

      "graph_reasoning": "The clause requiring 10% deposit for arbitration is a rational measure to deter frivolous claims in a commercial contract arising from a competitive tender process, where parties are on equal footing and the appellant voluntarily participated. Supreme Court precedents like Tata Cellular limit judicial review of tender terms to Wednesbury unreasonableness or manifest arbitrariness, which is not established here, distinguishing adhesion contract cases like Brojo Nath applicable to unequal bargaining in employment. Article 14 is not violated as the clause applies equally to both parties and bears a nexus to legitimate objectives.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The arbitration clause requiring a 10% deposit-at-call of the claimed amount constitutes an unconscionable term in a contract of adhesion with a public authority, where bargaining power is unequal, as established in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly. This deposit acts as a financial clog on accessing arbitration, an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, and is not justified merely to deter frivolous claims, which can be addressed through costs awards. The Supreme Court is likely to strike down the clause on public policy grounds to uphold fair access to justice."

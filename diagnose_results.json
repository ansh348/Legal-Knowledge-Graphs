Petitioner's constitutional challenges under Articles 14 and 19(1)(d),(e) lack strong support in the given arguments, as Section 27(1) likely qualifies as a reasonable restriction under Article 19(5) for maintaining public order, a common judicial stance for such preventive measures.

Respondents in the query admit irregularity but it was cured by facts (petitioner's letter and relocation), aligning with Case 1's acceptance of procedural satisfaction.

This pattern undermines the respondent's claim that the Judicial Commissioner's decision is final and unchallengeable in appeal.

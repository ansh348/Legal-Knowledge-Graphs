While High Courts and Tribunals cannot invoke prospective overruling, the Apex Court can and often does so to safeguard past actions consistent with V.

The High Court correctly set aside the Tribunal's prospective ruling, as declarations of rules ultra vires under constitutional provisions typically apply retrospectively unless specified otherwise. The current case involving similar G.O.M. No.14 reinforces the binding precedent, making it unlikely the appeal challenging the High Court's order will succeed."

Agriculturists Relief Act, 1934 (incorporated in the 1940 Act). The decree-holders admitted the other judgment-debtors were agriculturists and failed to rebut evidence or prove the joint family bar conclusively.

      "graph_reasoning": "The central issue is whether courts can direct regularization and creation of tractor driver posts absent any sanctioned post, which contravenes doctrines of judicial restraint, separation of powers, and the rule that regularization is only against sanctioned posts, as reinforced by cited precedents like Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Ram Jawaya. Petitioner's arguments directly align with these legal principles, while respondents' claims lack support for judicially mandating post creation. The Supreme Court is likely to accept the appeal and set aside the lower courts' directions.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The trial court correctly held that there is no sanctioned post of tractor driver, a finding of fact not disputed, and courts cannot direct creation of new posts as that is an executive function. Principles from cases like Umadevi prohibit regularization on unsanctioned posts, especially when employees were appointed and regularized as Mali and accepted it without protest. The High Court erred in upholding the first appellate court's direction to create the post, making the employer's appeal likely to succeed."

      "graph_reasoning": "The Supreme Court is likely to follow and extend the precedent in B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana, which permits quashing of non-compoundable offences under Section 482 CrPC or Article 226 when parties settle amicably, particularly in private disputes without significant public interest. This case involves a settled commercial dispute over vehicle financing under Sections 420/468/471 IPC, fitting the criteria for preventing abuse of process and securing ends of justice via harmonious construction of Sections 320 and 482 CrPC. Respondents' arguments for reconsidering B.S. Joshi are outweighed by the pragmatic approach emphasized in supporting precedents like Pepsi Foods.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The appeal challenges the High Court's refusal to quash an FIR for non-compoundable offenses (420/468/471 IPC) after parties settled a private commercial dispute. Precedent in B.S. Joshi (2003) explicitly permits quashing under S.482 CrPC or Art.226 to prevent abuse of process and secure justice, even for non-compoundable offenses. Arguments against reconsideration of B.S. Joshi are weak, as the offenses are private in nature with no ongoing public interest post-settlement."

      "graph_reasoning": "The defects in the verification and affidavit are minor and technical, specifying paragraphs based on personal knowledge versus information, and precedents like Murarka Radhey Shyam Ram Kumar and H D Revanna establish that such curable defects do not warrant dismissal under Section 86 RP Act. Legal concepts emphasize strict construction but opportunity to cure rather than summary dismissal, especially since non-compliance with Section 83 is not fatal. The Supreme Court is likely to accept the appeal, set aside the High Court's order, and remand for curing defects or trial on merits.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The High Court correctly identified fatal defects in the election petition under Section 83 of the RP Act, 1951, including the affidavit not conforming to Form 25, lacking proper affirmation/certification by a Magistrate/Notary, and failing to specify sources of information for corrupt practice allegations not based on personal knowledge, as required by Order VI Rule 15 CPC and precedents like Ajay Maken (2021). The petition's verification was general and did not distinguish knowledge from information specific to corrupt practices, violating mandatory provisions. Supreme Court consistently holds such non-compliance as jurisdictional defects leading to dismissal under Section 85, with no opportunity for cure post-objections."

      "graph_reasoning": "Section 25 of the Pondicherry Act grants the High Court wide revisional powers to interfere with findings of fact, unlike the narrower S.115 CPC, as affirmed in the cited Punnoose precedents, undermining the petitioner's argument that reversal was impermissible. The facts establish the premises as 60 years old with cracks, supporting eviction on dilapidation grounds with landlord's permissions obtained, alongside the ceased occupancy issue. The Supreme Court is thus likely to uphold the High Court's decision and reject the appeal.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The tenant-appellant argues that the High Court, exercising revisional jurisdiction under Section 25 of the Pondicherry Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act, 1969, could not reverse the factual findings of the First Appellate Court, citing M. Punnoose v. K.M. Munneruddin (2003) 10 SCC 610, which likely supports the limited scope of such jurisdiction to prevent re-appreciation of evidence absent perversity. In Indian rent control jurisprudence, revisional powers are supervisory and do not extend to substituting views on facts unless erroneous in law or jurisdictionally flawed. Thus, the Supreme Court is likely to find the High Court overstepped, accepting the appeal to restore the Appellate Authority's order favoring the tenant."

      "graph_reasoning": "The binding precedent in V. Jagannadha Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh holds that Special Rules under Article 309 permitting promotional transfers across cadres violate the Presidential Order under Article 371-D, particularly paras 3 and 5, and was applied prospectively by the Supreme Court. The High Court overstepped by setting aside the Tribunal's prospective application of this judgment, as the doctrine of prospective overruling is invocable only by the Apex Court under Article 142, not High Courts under Article 226. The procedural failure to implead necessary parties further renders the High Court order liable to be set aside, favoring acceptance of the appeal.",
      "raw_pred": 0,
      "raw_conf": 0.85,
      "raw_reasoning": "The Supreme Court in V. Jagannadha Rao held the special rules violative of the Presidential Order under Article 371-D without specifying prospective application, and such declarations of constitutional invalidity generally apply retrospectively, rendering prior appointments under the invalid rules void ab initio due to the overriding effect of Article 371-D(10). The High Court's decision to set aside the Tribunal's prospectivity ruling aligns with standard principles of judicial precedent, as overruling prior Supreme Court decisions implies the correct law always prevailed. No equities or indications in the facts suggest limiting the ruling to prospective effect."

      "graph_reasoning": "The arbitration clause requiring a 10% deposit applies equally to both parties, serves the legitimate purpose of deterring frivolous claims, and aligns with precedents like S.K. Jain v. State of Haryana upholding similar provisions and Tata Cellular limiting judicial scrutiny of tender terms unless manifestly arbitrary. Petitioner's reliance on Central Inland Water, an employment context, is distinguishable in commercial contracts where state entities have contractual freedom. The clause is proportionate with refund provisions and does not constitute a contract of adhesion warranting invalidation under Article 14.",

      "raw_reasoning": "The arbitration clause requiring a 10% deposit is part of a commercial tender contract applying equally to both parties, aimed at deterring frivolous claims, and falls within the realm of contract not ordinarily subject to judicial scrutiny unless arbitrary or discriminatory, as per Tata Cellular and Directorate of Education. The appellant's reliance on Central Inland Water Transport Corp. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly, which addressed unconscionable clauses in unequal adhesion contracts like employment, does not extend to arm's-length commercial dealings between a contractor and government board. Principles of judicial restraint in reviewing tender terms strongly favor upholding the clause, making rejection of the appeal likely."
